  "title": "Panama City Beach with My 70-Pound Dog: Embassy Suites Review",

  "content": "Last month, Ansel and I made the drive from Jacksonville to Panama City Beach for a long weekend. I\u0026rsquo;d been eyeing the Embassy Suites by Hilton Panama City Beach Resort for a while — it\u0026rsquo;s pet-friendly, right across from the beach, and I had a stack of Hilton points burning a hole in my account. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it went.\nSomeone approved of the room upgrade.\nThe Booking I used my Hilton Honors American Express Surpass points plus a free night certificate to book this stay. I stayed for 5 nights — and here\u0026rsquo;s a tip: when you book 4 nights with points, the 5th night is free. That\u0026rsquo;s a 20% discount built right in.\nThe only thing I actually paid out of pocket? Tipping the valet. That\u0026rsquo;s it.\nPet fees: $75 for stays of 1-4 nights, or $125 for 5+ nights. They allow up to 2 pets, max 75 lbs each, dogs and cats only. No breed restrictions. Ansel is a 70-pound German Shorthaired Pointer/Lab mix, so he squeaked in under the limit.\nPro tip: If you have Hilton Diamond status, request a room upgrade when you book. I asked and got bumped to a king suite with an ocean view and a balcony. Ansel spent a solid 20 minutes every morning just watching the beach from up there.\n(New to points and hotel status? Check out my guide to the best credit cards for pet travelers and how Hilton Diamond status works.)\nThe Hotel: What You Need to Know The Embassy Suites PCB is located right by Pier Park, across the street from the beach. Not beachfront, but close enough that it\u0026rsquo;s a 5-minute walk to sand. In fact, everything we did — Dog Beach, Pier Park, Margaritaville — was within walking distance of the hotel. We barely moved the car all week.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing nobody tells you: there\u0026rsquo;s only one elevator.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a dog — especially a bigger one who needs to go out first thing in the morning — request a room close to the elevator. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think to ask, and our first morning involved a very long hallway walk with an increasingly urgent pup. Lesson learned.\nMaking himself at home.\nThe room itself was spacious (it\u0026rsquo;s a suite, so you get a separate living area), clean, and the balcony was a huge win. Ansel could hang out there while I got ready without feeling cooped up.\nThe hotel also has designated dog areas around the property with poop bag stations, so those early morning and late night potty breaks are easy.\nNote: Dogs are not allowed at the pool. If you want pool time, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to plan around it (more on that below).\nThe Beach The big draw here is Dog Beach — an exclusive dog beach right across from Pier Park. You can see the \u0026ldquo;Welcome to Dog Beach\u0026rdquo; sign from Margaritaville. It\u0026rsquo;s a short walk from the hotel.\nThe destination.\nFirst time touching PCB sand.\nThat Gulf water is unreal.\nDog-Friendly Dining One of the best parts of PCB is how many restaurants have dog-friendly patios — and most of them are walking distance from the hotel. We hit up Margaritaville — great views, Ansel got tons of attention, and they didn\u0026rsquo;t bat an eye at a 70-pound dog under the table.\nLunch with a view.\nHe was very well-behaved (mostly).\nExploring Pier Park Pier Park is a huge outdoor shopping area right next to the hotel — literally a few minutes walk. Lots of stores, restaurants, and photo ops. Ansel found his way onto a Ron Jon surfboard.\nSurfer pup.\nRoad Trip Essentials: What I Packed A few things that made the drive with a 70-pound dog way easier:\nBackseat cover — Protects the seats, gives Ansel a non-slip surface, and makes cleanup a breeze. Travel water bottle with bowl — Attaches right to a cup holder. Perfect for rest stops. Poop bags — I always overpack. Running out at a hotel is not the move. (For my full packing list, check out road trip essentials for traveling with your dog.)\nNeed a Break? Daycare \u0026amp; Grooming Options Sometimes you want to hit the pool or grab dinner somewhere that isn\u0026rsquo;t dog-friendly. Here are your options near the hotel:\nZOOMIES Pet Hotel — Full daycare, boarding, and grooming. Book ahead, especially on weekends. Dagny and Dexter\u0026rsquo;s — Another solid daycare option nearby. PetSmart in Pier Park — Right next door for grooming or supplies. I dropped Ansel off here for a grooming session so I could spend a few hours at the pool. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend booking daycare in advance if you know you\u0026rsquo;ll want pool time or want to explore without the dog for a day.\nThe Verdict This was a genuinely easy trip. The hotel is well-located for a dog-friendly beach weekend, the points redemption felt like good value, and Ansel had a blast.\nWould I go back? Yeah, probably. Next time I\u0026rsquo;ll be smarter about requesting a room near the elevator, and I\u0026rsquo;ll book daycare in advance so I can get more pool time.\nAnsel\u0026rsquo;s Rating: 4/5 Paws 🐾🐾🐾🐾 What he loved: The balcony. The beach. All the new smells at Pier Park.\nWhat he didn\u0026rsquo;t love: That long hallway walk at 6am.\nQuick Reference Detail Info Hotel Embassy Suites by Hilton Panama City Beach Resort Location Across from beach, next to Pier Park Pet Policy 2 pets max, 75 lbs each, dogs/cats only, no breed restrictions Pet Fee $75 (1-4 nights) or $125 (5+ nights) Points Used Hilton Honors (via Surpass card + free night cert) Out of Pocket Valet tip only Dog-Friendly Beach Dog Beach, walking distance Dog Areas On-site with poop bag stations Pool No dogs allowed — use grooming/daycare for pool time Grooming PetSmart in Pier Park Daycare ZOOMIES Pet Hotel, Dagny and Dexter\u0026rsquo;s (book ahead!)

  "url": "http://localhost:1313/posts/road-trip-essentials-dogs/",
  "content": "I\u0026rsquo;ve done enough road trips with Ansel to know what\u0026rsquo;s actually worth packing — and what just takes up space. Here\u0026rsquo;s my go-to list for traveling with a 70-pound dog.\n🚗 Car Setup Seat cover — Non-negotiable. I use one in my 4Runner that covers the entire back seat, has flaps that protect the doors, and is waterproof. Saves your interior from muddy paws, sand, and the occasional drool puddle.\nCrash-tested crate — If your dog does better contained, a crate is the safest option. Brands like Gunner and Ruff Land are pricey but built to protect your dog in an accident. Worth it for peace of mind on long drives.\nCar barrier — If a crate doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit your setup, a barrier keeps them in the back without roaming into the front seat. Less secure than a crate, but better than nothing.\nSeat belt harness — Another safety option if you don\u0026rsquo;t use a crate. Clips into your seatbelt and keeps your dog secured. Look for crash-tested options.\n💧 Food \u0026amp; Water Travel water bottle with bowl attachment — This is the one thing I\u0026rsquo;d never skip. Mine has a bowl that screws onto the top, so I can give Ansel water at rest stops without digging through bags. Fits right in the cup holder.\nCollapsible bowls — Cheap, packable, and useful for food or water at the hotel. I keep a couple in my bag at all times.\nFood storage — I portion out food into ziplock bags or use a small airtight container. Keeps things simple and avoids lugging an entire bag of kibble.\n🛏️ Comfort Items Pet blanket — Ansel has a designated travel blanket. It smells like home, which helps him settle in unfamiliar hotel rooms. Also useful for covering hotel furniture if you\u0026rsquo;re worried about fur.\nFavorite toy — Something familiar to keep them occupied during downtime. Don\u0026rsquo;t bring anything too squeaky unless you want to hear it for 5 hours straight.\nTreats — For rewarding good behavior, training moments, and bribing them back into the car after a rest stop. I pack more than I think I\u0026rsquo;ll need.\n🧹 Safety \u0026amp; Cleanup Poop bags — I always overpack. Running out at a hotel or rest stop is not a situation you want to be in. Bring twice as many as you think you need.\nPet first aid kit — Basic stuff: bandages, antiseptic wipes, tweezers for ticks, Benadryl (ask your vet for dosage). You probably won\u0026rsquo;t need it, but you\u0026rsquo;ll be glad you have it.\nTowels — At least one or two. For wet paws, muddy adventures, post-beach shakeoffs, or unexpected messes. Old towels work great.\nLint roller — Your future self will thank you. Keep one in the car and one in your bag.\n📋 Documents Vaccination records — Some hotels ask for proof of rabies vaccination. Keep a copy on your phone or in the car. I take a photo of Ansel\u0026rsquo;s records so I always have them.\nID tags — Make sure your dog\u0026rsquo;s tags are up to date with your current phone number. Travel is the worst time for a tag with an old number.\nMicrochip info — Know your microchip number and make sure your contact info is current in the registry. Takes 5 minutes to check online.\n✅ The Quick Packing Checklist If you\u0026rsquo;re in a hurry, here\u0026rsquo;s the minimum:\nEssential Why 🚗 Seat cover Protect your car 💧 Water bottle with bowl Hydration at rest stops 💩 Poop bags (lots) Don\u0026rsquo;t run out 🛏️ Blanket Comfort + furniture protection 🦴 Treats Bribes work 🦮 Leash Obviously 📋 Vaccination records Hotels may ask Everything else is nice to have but not essential for a weekend trip.\n🐾 Where I\u0026rsquo;ve Used This Stuff Most recently, Ansel and I did 5 nights in Panama City Beach — about a 5-hour drive from Jacksonville. This packing list kept us covered the whole trip.\nThe seat cover handled sandy paws after the beach, the water bottle was a lifesaver at rest stops, and the blanket made the hotel room feel like home.\n🛒 My Gear Recommendations Here\u0026rsquo;s what I personally use:\nItem What I Use Notes Seat cover Waterproof hammock-style Covers doors too Water bottle Bottle with flip-up bowl Cup holder friendly Crate Gunner G1 Pricey but bombproof First aid kit Pre-made pet kit + Benadryl Check with your vet on dosage Blanket Old fleece blanket Smells like home (Affiliate links coming soon — I\u0026rsquo;ll update this post once I\u0026rsquo;m partnered with Amazon.)\nHave a road trip essential I missed? Let me know — I\u0026rsquo;m always looking to upgrade my setup.\n",

  "content": "If you travel with your dog and aren\u0026rsquo;t using hotel credit cards, you\u0026rsquo;re leaving money on the table. Pet fees, room rates, and all those extras add up fast — but the right cards can offset most of it with points, free nights, and elite status perks.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I use and recommend for pet travelers.\nWhy Hotel Cards Make Sense for Pet Owners Most pet-friendly hotels charge $50–$150 per stay in pet fees. You can\u0026rsquo;t avoid those (yet), but you can make the room itself free by booking with points. And with elite status, you get perks like room upgrades, late checkout, and free breakfast — all of which make traveling with a dog way easier.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t paid for a hotel room in years. I use Hilton points from my credit cards, and the free night certificates cover the rest.\nMy Setup: The Hilton Combo I\u0026rsquo;m loyal to Hilton because their pet policies are solid (most properties allow dogs up to 75 lbs with no breed restrictions), and their credit cards are some of the best in the game.\n💎 Hilton Honors American Express Aspire The premium option for serious travelers.\nAnnual Fee $550 Status Diamond (top tier) Sign-Up Bonus 175,000 points after $6,000 spend in 6 months Free Nights 1/year, plus more at $30k and $60k spend This is the card if you\u0026rsquo;re serious about hotel travel. Diamond status gets you room upgrades, executive lounge access, and late checkout — all super helpful when traveling with a dog.\nThat 175,000-point bonus alone is worth around 2–3 free nights at most Hilton properties. Combined with the annual free night certificate, you could have a week\u0026rsquo;s worth of hotel stays from day one.\nKey perks:\n✈️ Up to $200/year in flight credits ($50/quarter) 🏨 Up to $400/year in Hilton resort credits ($200 every 6 months) 🚀 Up to $209/year CLEAR credit 🛎️ $100 credit at Waldorf Astoria and Conrad properties 💳 14x points at Hilton, 7x on dining and flights, 3x everything else 💡 Pro tip: You don\u0026rsquo;t have to book flights to use the flight credit. Buy airline gift cards or add funds to your travel bank (Delta, Southwest, etc.) — they count toward the credit and don\u0026rsquo;t expire for 5 years. Easy way to bank the $200 even if you\u0026rsquo;re not flying soon.\nHow the $550 fee pays for itself:\nPerk Value Annual free night certificate $300+ Hilton resort credits $400 Flight credits $200 CLEAR credit $209 Total $1,100+ Even if you only use half of these, you\u0026rsquo;re coming out ahead.\n🥇 Hilton Honors American Express Surpass The sweet spot for most pet travelers.\nAnnual Fee $150 Status Gold (Diamond at $40k/year spend) Sign-Up Bonus 155,000 points after $3,000 spend in 6 months Free Nights 1 after $15k spend in a calendar year This is the sweet spot for most travelers. Gold status gets you the 5th night free on award stays, plus a daily food \u0026amp; beverage credit or free breakfast at most properties.\nThe sign-up bonus is easier to hit than the Aspire ($3k vs $6k), and 155,000 points is still enough for multiple free nights.\nKey perks:\n🏨 Up to $200/year in Hilton credits ($50/quarter) 💳 12x points at Hilton, 6x on dining/groceries/gas, 3x everything else 🌙 Free night after $15k spend 💡 Pro tip: The quarterly $50 credit works on any purchase at a Hilton property — you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a guest. Grab dinner or drinks at a Hilton restaurant near you, and you\u0026rsquo;ve used your credit. Do that 4 times a year and you\u0026rsquo;ve made back more than the annual fee.\nHow the $150 fee pays for itself:\nPerk Value Quarterly Hilton credits $200 Total $200 Just by using the $50 quarterly credit, you\u0026rsquo;re $50 ahead before you even count the points you\u0026rsquo;re earning. If you hit the $15k spend for the free night certificate, that\u0026rsquo;s another $200+ in value.\nI carry both the Aspire and Surpass. Between them, I get 2–3 free night certificates per year, plus enough points from everyday spending to cover several more nights.\n🆓 Hilton Honors American Express (No Annual Fee) The risk-free starting point.\nAnnual Fee $0 Status Silver Sign-Up Bonus 100,000 points after $2,000 spend in 6 months Free Nights None If you\u0026rsquo;re just getting started, this is a no-risk way to begin earning Hilton points. You won\u0026rsquo;t get a free night certificate, but you still get the 5th night free benefit on award stays, which is a 20% discount on any points redemption of 5+ nights.\n100,000 points for just $2,000 in spending — with no annual fee — is one of the best entry points into hotel rewards.\nKey perks:\n💳 7x points at Hilton, 5x on dining/groceries/gas, 3x everything else 🆓 No annual fee 🌙 5th night free on award stays The Alternative: Marriott 🏨 Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Best for Marriott loyalists.\nAnnual Fee $95 Status Silver Elite (Gold at $35k/year spend) Sign-Up Bonus 3 free nights (each up to 50,000 points) after $3,000 spend in 3 months Free Nights 1/year (up to 35,000 points, can top off with 15k more) That sign-up bonus is huge — 3 free nights at properties up to 50,000 points each. That could cover a long weekend at a solid Marriott property right out of the gate.\nKey perks:\n💳 Up to 17x points at Marriott properties 🍽️ 3x on dining, groceries, and gas (first $6k/year) 🌙 Annual free night certificate ⭐ 15 Elite Night Credits per year How the $95 fee pays for itself:\nPerk Value Annual free night certificate $200+ Total $200+ The free night certificate alone is worth at least double the annual fee at most Marriott properties. You can also top it off with up to 15,000 additional points to book nicer hotels.\nMarriott\u0026rsquo;s pet policies vary more by property than Hilton\u0026rsquo;s, so always check before booking. Some Marriott brands (like Residence Inn and TownePlace Suites) tend to be more consistently pet-friendly.\nWhich Card Should You Get? You\u0026hellip; Get This Why 🆕 New to points Hilton (no fee) 100k bonus, no risk 🐕 Travel 2–4x/year Hilton Surpass $200 credits \u0026gt; $150 fee ✈️ Travel frequently Hilton Aspire $1,100 in perks, Diamond upgrades 🏨 Prefer Marriott Marriott Boundless 3 free nights bonus, $95 fee How I Booked Panama City Beach for Free For my recent 5-night trip to Panama City Beach, I used:\n✅ Hilton points (earned from my Surpass card) ✅ The 5th night free benefit (book 4 nights with points, get the 5th free) Total out of pocket for the room: $0\nI still paid the $125 pet fee (5+ nights), but that\u0026rsquo;s a lot easier to stomach when the room was free.\nQuick Comparison Card Annual Fee Sign-Up Bonus Credits/Perks Free Night 💎 Hilton Aspire $550 175k points $1,100+/year Yes (annual) 🥇 Hilton Surpass $150 155k points $200/year After $15k spend 🆓 Hilton (no fee) $0 100k points — No 🏨 Marriott Boundless $95 3 free nights — Yes (annual) The Bottom Line Pet travel gets expensive fast. The right credit cards won\u0026rsquo;t eliminate pet fees, but they can make the room free — and that\u0026rsquo;s a huge win.\nThe annual fees on these cards look scary at first, but once you factor in the credits and free nights, most of them pay you back more than you put in. Start with whichever card fits your budget and travel frequency, and build from there.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been running this setup for years, and it\u0026rsquo;s saved me thousands. If you\u0026rsquo;re road tripping with your dog anyway, you might as well do it for free.\nQuestions about which card is right for you? Reach out — happy to help.\n",

  "title": "Hilton Diamond Status: How to Get It and Why It's Worth It",
  "url": "http://localhost:1313/posts/hilton-diamond-status-guide/",
  "content": "Hilton Diamond is the top tier of Hilton Honors (until Diamond Reserve launches in 2026), and it comes with perks that make traveling with a dog way easier — room upgrades, late checkout, free breakfast, and more.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how I got it and why it\u0026rsquo;s worth pursuing.\n💎 How I Got Diamond Status I earned Diamond status two ways:\nFirst time: I hit the $40,000 spending threshold on my Hilton Surpass card through everyday spending — groceries, gas, dining, bills. Once you hit that number, Diamond status kicks in within a few weeks.\nNow: I carry the Hilton Aspire card, which gives you automatic Diamond status just for having the card. No spending threshold, no stays required — you\u0026rsquo;re Diamond from day one.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re serious about hotel travel, the Aspire is the easier path. If you\u0026rsquo;re already putting significant spend on a Surpass card, you might hit Diamond that way first.\n⭐ Diamond Status Benefits Here\u0026rsquo;s what you actually get:\nBenefit What It Means 🛏️ Room upgrades Up to 1-bedroom suites, based on availability 🍳 Daily food \u0026amp; beverage credit At U.S. properties (or free breakfast internationally) 🍸 Executive lounge access Free breakfast, snacks, drinks (where available) ⏰ Late checkout Sleep in, no rush 💯 100% bonus points Double the base points on every stay 🌙 5th night free Book 4 nights with points, get the 5th free 📶 Premium WiFi Fastest speeds in the hotel ✅ 48-hour room guarantee Guaranteed room if booked 48+ hours ahead 🎁 Welcome amenities Snacks, water bottles, treats at check-in (varies by property) 🏨 The Perks I Actually Use Room Upgrades This is the big one. As a Diamond member, I\u0026rsquo;ve been upgraded to suites multiple times — including an ocean-view suite at the Embassy Suites in Panama City Beach. More space means more room for the dog to spread out, and a balcony is a game-changer for morning coffee while Ansel watches the beach.\nPro tip: When you book, add a note requesting an upgrade. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee anything, but it puts you on their radar.\nDaily Food \u0026amp; Beverage Credit At most U.S. Hilton properties, Diamond members get a daily F\u0026amp;B credit instead of free breakfast. The amount varies by brand (usually $15–$25 per person), and it applies to you plus one guest.\n💡 Pro tip: These credits stack. Staying 3 nights? That\u0026rsquo;s 3 days of credits you can use whenever — save them up and have a nice dinner on your last night, or use them at the bar.\nLate Checkout When you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a dog, late checkout is clutch. No rushing to pack up and get the dog out by 11am. I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten 2pm checkout at most properties just by asking at the front desk.\nExecutive Lounge Access Where available, Diamond members can access the executive lounge for free breakfast, evening appetizers, and drinks. These are more common at international properties — in the U.S., they\u0026rsquo;re hit or miss. But when you find one, it\u0026rsquo;s a nice quiet spot to grab coffee or a snack.\nWelcome Amenities This varies by property, but I\u0026rsquo;ve received complimentary water bottles, snacks, and even treats for Ansel at check-in. Small touches that make you feel recognized.\n🎯 Ways to Earn Diamond Status Method Requirement 💳 Hilton Aspire card Automatic — just have the card 💳 Hilton Surpass card Spend $40,000 in a calendar year 🛏️ Stays 30 stays in a calendar year 🌙 Nights 60 nights in a calendar year ⭐ Base points Earn 120,000 base points in a calendar year For most people, the credit card path is the easiest. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re traveling for work constantly, hitting 60 nights is tough. But everyday spending on a Surpass or Aspire card? That adds up fast.\n💳 The Credit Card Shortcut Hilton Aspire ($550/year) Automatic Diamond status — no spend required Annual free night certificate $400/year in Hilton resort credits $200/year in flight credits (buy airline gift cards — they count!) 175,000 point sign-up bonus Hilton Surpass ($150/year) Gold status automatic, Diamond at $40k spend $200/year in Hilton credits ($50/quarter — use at any Hilton property, even just for dinner) Free night after $15k spend 155,000 point sign-up bonus If you want Diamond without the $550 Aspire fee, the Surpass path works — it just takes more spending. I did it for a couple years before upgrading to the Aspire.\nFor the full breakdown, check out my Best Credit Cards for Pet Travelers guide.\n🌙 Free Night Certificates: The Secret Weapon One of my favorite Diamond perks isn\u0026rsquo;t technically a Diamond perk — it\u0026rsquo;s the free night certificates from the Aspire card. But here\u0026rsquo;s what most people don\u0026rsquo;t realize:\nThese certificates work at almost any Hilton property.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve used mine at resorts where rooms go for $400–$500/night. Some people have used them at properties charging $1,000+ per night. The certificate covers one standard night, regardless of the cash price.\nSo while you\u0026rsquo;re earning Diamond status and racking up points, those free night certificates are quietly saving you hundreds of dollars per year.\n🐕 Why Diamond Matters for Pet Travelers Here\u0026rsquo;s why I think Diamond status is especially valuable when you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a dog:\nSuite upgrades = more space. A regular hotel room with a 70-pound dog feels cramped. A suite with a separate living area? Much better.\nLate checkout = less stress. Morning potty breaks, packing up dog gear, loading the car — it all takes longer with a pet. Late checkout gives you breathing room.\nF\u0026amp;B credits = save money. Pet fees add up. Having your meals partially covered helps offset those costs.\nWelcome amenities. Some properties include dog treats or pet welcome packages for Diamond members. It\u0026rsquo;s not guaranteed, but it happens.\n📅 What\u0026rsquo;s Coming: Diamond Reserve (2026) Hilton is adding a new tier above Diamond starting January 2026 — Diamond Reserve. It requires 80 nights or 40 stays PLUS $18,000 in eligible spend.\nThe perks include confirmable suite upgrades at booking, guaranteed 4pm late checkout, and 120% bonus points. For most travelers, regular Diamond will still be the goal — but it\u0026rsquo;s good to know what\u0026rsquo;s coming.\nThe good news: nothing changes for current Diamond members. All the existing benefits stay the same.\n✅ The Bottom Line Diamond status makes hotel travel more comfortable — especially with a dog.

  "content": "Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m Dani 👋 I\u0026rsquo;m a software engineer based in Jacksonville, Florida — and I haven\u0026rsquo;t paid for a hotel stay in years.\nA few years ago, a friend introduced me to credit card points and hotel loyalty programs. I went down the rabbit hole, learned the system inside and out, and built a strategy that keeps me traveling without spending cash on hotels. Between Hilton Honors points, free night certificates, and stacking welcome offers, I\u0026rsquo;ve turned loyalty programs into a reliable way to travel for free.\nWhy Pet Travel? This is Ansel — my 2-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer/Lab mix. He\u0026rsquo;s 70 pounds of energy, curiosity, and enthusiasm for literally everything. He loves hiking, chasing birds, meeting new people, and going anywhere that isn\u0026rsquo;t the house.\nHe\u0026rsquo;s well-trained enough that I can take him to restaurants, breweries, and patios without any issues. But I wanted more for us — road trips, beach weekends, and new places to explore together.\nThe problem? Flying with a 70-pound dog isn\u0026rsquo;t really an option. So I combined what I know about points and hotel programs with deep research on pet policies, fees, and what actually works for travelers with big dogs.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how ThePointsPup started.\nWhat You\u0026rsquo;ll Find Here Trip reports from dog-friendly destinations Credit card strategies for earning hotel points fast Honest hotel reviews with real info on pet policies and fees Road trip guides focused on the Southeast and beyond The Setup Cards I Use:\nHilton Honors American Express Aspire Hilton Honors American Express Surpass My Dog: Ansel, 2-year-old GSP/Lab mix, 70 lbs, very good boy\nHome Base: Jacksonville, FL\nHave a pet-friendly hotel you want me to check out?

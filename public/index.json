  "content": "If you travel with your dog and aren\u0026rsquo;t using hotel credit cards, you\u0026rsquo;re leaving money on the table. Pet fees, room rates, and all those extras add up fast — but the right cards can offset most of it with points, free nights, and elite status perks.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I use and recommend for pet travelers.\nJump to:\nWhy Hotel Cards Make Sense The Hilton Combo Hilton Aspire Hilton Surpass Hilton No Fee For Kimpton: IHG \u0026amp; Chase Marriott Alternative Which Card Should You Get? Why Hotel Cards Make Sense for Pet Owners Most pet-friendly hotels charge $50–$150 per stay in pet fees. You can\u0026rsquo;t avoid those (yet), but you can make the room itself free by booking with points. And with elite status, you get perks like room upgrades, late checkout, and free breakfast — all of which make traveling with a dog way easier.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t paid for a hotel room in years. I use Hilton points from my credit cards, and the free night certificates cover the rest.\nMy Setup: The Hilton Combo I\u0026rsquo;m loyal to Hilton because their pet policies are solid (most properties allow dogs up to 75 lbs with no breed restrictions), and their credit cards are some of the best in the game.\n💎 Hilton Honors American Express Aspire The premium option for serious travelers.\nAnnual Fee $550 Status Diamond (top tier) Sign-Up Bonus 175,000 points after $6,000 spend in 6 months Free Nights 1/year, plus more at $30k and $60k spend This is the card if you\u0026rsquo;re serious about hotel travel. Diamond status gets you room upgrades, executive lounge access, and late checkout — all super helpful when traveling with a dog.\nThat 175,000-point bonus alone is worth around 2–3 free nights at most Hilton properties. Combined with the annual free night certificate, you could have a week\u0026rsquo;s worth of hotel stays from day one.\nKey perks:\n✈️ Up to $200/year in flight credits ($50/quarter) 🏨 Up to $400/year in Hilton resort credits ($200 every 6 months) 🚀 Up to $209/year CLEAR credit 🛎️ $100 credit at Waldorf Astoria and Conrad properties 💳 14x points at Hilton, 7x on dining and flights, 3x everything else 💡 Pro tip: You don\u0026rsquo;t have to book flights to use the flight credit. Buy airline gift cards or add funds to your travel bank (Delta, Southwest, etc.) — they count toward the credit and don\u0026rsquo;t expire for 5 years. Easy way to bank the $200 even if you\u0026rsquo;re not flying soon.\nHow the $550 fee pays for itself:\nPerk Value Annual free night certificate $300+ Hilton resort credits $400 Flight credits $200 CLEAR credit $209 Total $1,100+ Even if you only use half of these, you\u0026rsquo;re coming out ahead.\n🥇 Hilton Honors American Express Surpass The sweet spot for most pet travelers.\nAnnual Fee $150 Status Gold (Diamond at $40k/year spend) Sign-Up Bonus 155,000 points after $3,000 spend in 6 months Free Nights 1 after $15k spend in a calendar year This is the sweet spot for most travelers. Gold status gets you the 5th night free on award stays, plus a daily food \u0026amp; beverage credit or free breakfast at most properties.\nThe sign-up bonus is easier to hit than the Aspire ($3k vs $6k), and 155,000 points is still enough for multiple free nights.\nKey perks:\n🏨 Up to $200/year in Hilton credits ($50/quarter) 💳 12x points at Hilton, 6x on dining/groceries/gas, 3x everything else 🌙 Free night after $15k spend 💡 Pro tip: The quarterly $50 credit works on any purchase at a Hilton property — you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a guest. Grab dinner or drinks at a Hilton restaurant near you, and you\u0026rsquo;ve used your credit. Do that 4 times a year and you\u0026rsquo;ve made back more than the annual fee.\nHow the $150 fee pays for itself:\nPerk Value Quarterly Hilton credits $200 Total $200 Just by using the $50 quarterly credit, you\u0026rsquo;re $50 ahead before you even count the points you\u0026rsquo;re earning. If you hit the $15k spend for the free night certificate, that\u0026rsquo;s another $200+ in value.\nI carry both the Aspire and Surpass. Between them, I get 2–3 free night certificates per year, plus enough points from everyday spending to cover several more nights.\n🆓 Hilton Honors American Express (No Annual Fee) The risk-free starting point.\nAnnual Fee $0 Status Silver Sign-Up Bonus 100,000 points after $2,000 spend in 6 months Free Nights None If you\u0026rsquo;re just getting started, this is a no-risk way to begin earning Hilton points. You won\u0026rsquo;t get a free night certificate, but you still get the 5th night free benefit on award stays, which is a 20% discount on any points redemption of 5+ nights.\n100,000 points for just $2,000 in spending — with no annual fee — is one of the best entry points into hotel rewards.\nKey perks:\n💳 7x points at Hilton, 5x on dining/groceries/gas, 3x everything else 🆓 No annual fee 🌙 5th night free on award stays For Kimpton Travelers: IHG \u0026amp; Chase Cards Kimpton has the best pet policy in the industry — no fees, no weight limits, no breed restrictions. If that\u0026rsquo;s your priority, you\u0026rsquo;ll need IHG points (Kimpton is part of IHG).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t carry these cards yet, but they\u0026rsquo;re worth considering if Kimpton is your target.\n🏨 IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card Best if you\u0026rsquo;ll stay at IHG/Kimpton regularly.\nAnnual Fee $99 Sign-Up Bonus 140,000 points after $3,000 spend in 3 months Free Night 1/year (up to 40,000 points) Status Platinum Elite That 140,000-point bonus is enough for 2-4 free nights at most Kimptons.\nKey perks:\n💳 26x points at IHG properties 🌙 4th night free on award stays (book 4, pay for 3) 🎁 Annual free night certificate How the $99 fee pays for itself:\nPerk Value Annual free night certificate $200+ Total $200+ 🆓 IHG One Rewards Traveler Credit Card The no-risk IHG option.\nAnnual Fee $0 Sign-Up Bonus 80,000 points after $2,000 spend in 3 months Free Night None If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure how often you\u0026rsquo;ll stay at Kimpton/IHG, this gets you started with no commitment.\nKey perks:\n💳 17x points at IHG properties 🍽️ 3x on dining, gas, and groceries 🌙 4th night free on award stays (yes, even with the no-fee card) 💳 Chase Sapphire Preferred Best for flexibility across multiple hotel programs.\nAnnual Fee $95 Sign-Up Bonus 60,000 points after $4,000 spend in 3 months Chase Ultimate Rewards points transfer 1:1 to IHG — and to Hyatt, Marriott, and 10+ airline partners. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to commit to one hotel chain, this is the move.\nKey perks:\n💳 3x on dining, select streaming, and online groceries ✈️ 2x on travel 🔄 Points transfer to 14+ airline and hotel partners 💡 Pro tip: If you already have Hilton cards and want to add Kimpton as an option, the Sapphire Preferred is a good complement. Transfer to IHG when you find a Kimpton you want, keep your Hilton setup for everything else.\nFull breakdown: How to Book Kimpton Free with Points\nThe Alternative: Marriott 🏨 Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Best for Marriott loyalists.\nAnnual Fee $95 Status Silver Elite (Gold at $35k/year spend) Sign-Up Bonus 3 free nights (each up to 50,000 points) after $3,000 spend in 3 months Free Nights 1/year (up to 35,000 points, can top off with 15k more) That sign-up bonus is huge — 3 free nights at properties up to 50,000 points each. That could cover a long weekend at a solid Marriott property right out of the gate.\nKey perks:\n💳 Up to 17x points at Marriott properties 🍽️ 3x on dining, groceries, and gas (first $6k/year) 🌙 Annual free night certificate ⭐ 15 Elite Night Credits per year How the $95 fee pays for itself:\nPerk Value Annual free night certificate $200+ Total $200+ The free night certificate alone is worth at least double the annual fee at most Marriott properties. You can also top it off with up to 15,000 additional points to book nicer hotels.\nMarriott\u0026rsquo;s pet policies vary more by property than Hilton\u0026rsquo;s, so always check before booking. Some Marriott brands (like Residence Inn and TownePlace Suites) tend to be more consistently pet-friendly.\nWhich Card Should You Get? You\u0026hellip; Get This Why 🆕 New to points Hilton (no fee) 100k bonus, no risk 🐕 Travel 2–4x/year Hilton Surpass $200 credits \u0026gt; $150 fee ✈️ Travel frequently Hilton Aspire $1,100 in perks, Diamond upgrades 🐕‍🦺 Have a large dog IHG Premier Kimpton has no weight limits 🔄 Want flexibility Chase Sapphire Preferred Transfer to IHG, Hyatt, airlines 🏨 Prefer Marriott Marriott Boundless 3 free nights bonus, $95 fee How I Booked Panama City Beach for Free For my recent 5-night trip to Panama City Beach, I used:\n✅ Hilton points (earned from my Surpass card) ✅ The 5th night free benefit (book 4 nights with points, get the 5th free) Total out of pocket for the room: $0\nI still paid the $125 pet fee (5+ nights), but that\u0026rsquo;s a lot easier to stomach when the room was free.\nQuick Comparison Card Annual Fee Sign-Up Bonus Credits/Perks Free Night 💎 Hilton Aspire $550 175k points $1,100+/year Yes (annual) 🥇 Hilton Surpass $150 155k points $200/year After $15k spend 🆓 Hilton (no fee) $0 100k points — No 🏨 IHG Premier $99 140k points — Yes (annual) 🆓 IHG Traveler $0 80k points — No 💳 Chase Sapphire Preferred $95 60k points — No 🏨 Marriott Boundless $95 3 free nights — Yes (annual) The Bottom Line Pet travel gets expensive fast. The right credit cards won\u0026rsquo;t eliminate pet fees, but they can make the room free — and that\u0026rsquo;s a huge win.\nThe annual fees on these cards look scary at first, but once you factor in the credits and free nights, most of them pay you back more than you put in. Start with whichever card fits your budget and travel frequency, and build from there.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been running this setup for years, and it\u0026rsquo;s saved me thousands. If you\u0026rsquo;re road tripping with your dog anyway, you might as well do it for free.\nQuestions about which card is right for you?

  "title": "Best Pet-Friendly Beach Towns Near Jacksonville",
  "url": "http://localhost:1313/posts/pet-friendly-beach-towns-jacksonville/",
  "content": "Living in Jacksonville means you\u0026rsquo;re surrounded by beach towns worth exploring with your dog. Some are close enough for a lazy lunch. Others are worth a full weekend. Here are the spots Ansel and I keep coming back to.\n(Hitting the road? Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to check out my road trip essentials for traveling with your dog.)\nJacksonville Beach Drive time: 25 minutes\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to go far. Jax Beach has a ton of dog-friendly restaurants — over 40 according to BringFido — so finding a patio that welcomes your pup is never a problem.\nOne favorite is Salt Life Food Shack, just three blocks from the beach. Dogs are welcome on the downstairs patio, and they\u0026rsquo;ll bring out a water bowl without you asking. Great surf-and-turf menu with tacos, sushi rolls, and fresh seafood. It\u0026rsquo;s casual, breezy, and Ansel always gets compliments from other diners.\nPro tip: Go for a late lunch to beat the crowds. The patio fills up fast on weekends.\nAmelia Island Drive time: 45 minutes\nThis is one of the most dog-friendly spots in the area. The beaches allow leashed dogs, downtown Fernandina Beach has plenty of dog-friendly patios, and the whole island has a relaxed, walkable vibe. Great for a day trip or a quick overnight.\nOne spot I always recommend is The Patio at 5th and Ash — a casual American bistro with a beautiful outdoor patio under oak trees draped in Spanish moss. They\u0026rsquo;re genuinely dog-friendly and even have a dog menu with homemade biscuits. Ansel was very focused on earning one.\nPro tip: If you\u0026rsquo;re staying overnight, check out the Hilton properties on the island. Some are pet-friendly and bookable on points. (See my credit cards guide for how I earn free nights.)\nPalm Coast / Flagler Beach Drive time: 1 hour 15 minutes\nFlagler Beach is low-key and locals love it. Dogs are allowed on the beach (leashed), and the pier area has a few casual spots to grab food. It\u0026rsquo;s less crowded than Daytona and has more of a small-town feel.\nThis is a good \u0026ldquo;decompress\u0026rdquo; destination — not a ton of activities, just beach, food, and chill. Sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what you need.\nNew Smyrna Beach Drive time: 2 hours\nNSB has a great mix of beach access and dog-friendly dining. The vibe is artsy and laid-back — lots of murals, local shops, and good food.\nOne spot I always stop at is Yellow Dog Eats — a funky sandwich shop with a big outdoor patio where dogs are welcome. The food is creative (think smoked meats, interesting sandwiches), and the whole place just feels like it was made for people who travel with their dogs.\nAnsel cooling off on the patio. That sign in the background says it all.\nHe\u0026rsquo;s very polite about sharing. Usually.\nDaytona Beach Drive time: 1 hour 45 minutes\nDaytona is hit or miss for dogs — the main beach doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow them during peak hours, but there are designated dog-friendly areas. The boardwalk area has some pet-friendly patios, and it\u0026rsquo;s a good base if you want to explore the surrounding towns.\nHonestly, I usually skip Daytona proper and head to NSB or Flagler instead. But if you\u0026rsquo;re in the area, it\u0026rsquo;s worth a stop.\nQuick Reference Destination Drive Time Beach Access Best For Jacksonville Beach 25 min Limited dog hours Quick lunch, tons of patios Amelia Island 45 min Leashed dogs allowed Day trip or weekend, walkable downtown Flagler Beach 1 hr 15 min Leashed dogs allowed Quiet beach day, low-key vibes New Smyrna Beach 2 hrs Dog-friendly areas Artsy town, great food, worth a weekend Daytona Beach 1 hr 45 min Designated areas only Skip unless passing through The Bottom Line All of these are easy drives from Jacksonville and make great trips with your dog. Pack a travel bag, book a pet-friendly hotel (on points, of course), and go explore.\nWant more posts about the places we eat and stay?

  "content": "If you\u0026rsquo;ve traveled with a large dog, you know the drill: call ahead, confirm the weight limit, hope they don\u0026rsquo;t give you a hard time at check-in. It gets old.\nKimpton doesn\u0026rsquo;t play that game. Their policy is simple: if your pet fits through the door, they\u0026rsquo;re welcome. No weight limit. No breed restrictions. No pet fee. Ever.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the most genuinely pet-friendly hotel chain I\u0026rsquo;ve found — and you can book stays completely free using credit card points.\nJump to:\nWhy Kimpton for Pet Travelers How to Earn IHG Points IHG Credit Cards Chase Transfer Partners How Many Points You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Best Kimptons for Dogs Which Card Should You Get? Why Kimpton for Pet Travelers Kimpton became the first major hotel chain to go pet-friendly back in 1992. They weren\u0026rsquo;t just tolerating pets — they built it into the brand. Here\u0026rsquo;s what you actually get:\nNo pet fee — not even for extended stays No weight or breed restrictions — Great Danes, pit bulls, whatever Pet amenities included — loaner beds, bowls, treats at check-in Pet-friendly wine hour — the nightly hosted reception welcomes dogs Director of Pet Relations at some properties — yes, it\u0026rsquo;s a dog With 77+ locations in the US and a few international properties, you\u0026rsquo;ve got solid coverage in most major cities.\nThe catch? Kimpton is a boutique brand, so rates tend to run higher than your typical Hilton or Marriott. That\u0026rsquo;s where points come in.\nHow to Earn IHG Points for Kimpton Kimpton is part of IHG (InterContinental Hotels Group), so you book using IHG One Rewards points. There are two main ways to stack up enough points for free stays:\nIHG credit cards (direct earning) Chase Ultimate Rewards (transfer partner) Option 1: IHG Credit Cards If you stay at IHG properties regularly, their co-branded Chase cards make sense.\n💎 IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card The card for frequent IHG travelers.\nAnnual Fee $99 Sign-Up Bonus 140,000 points after $3,000 spend in 3 months Free Night 1/year at properties up to 40,000 points Status Platinum Elite That 140,000-point bonus is enough for 2-4 free nights at most Kimptons, depending on the property and dates.\nKey perks:\n💳 26x points at IHG properties ✈️ 5x on travel, gas, and restaurants 🌙 4th night free on award stays (book 4, pay for 3) 🎁 Annual free night certificate 💡 Pro tip: The 4th night free benefit is huge. If you\u0026rsquo;re booking a 4-night Kimpton stay with points, you\u0026rsquo;re effectively getting 25% off. A 200,000-point redemption becomes 150,000.\nHow the $99 fee pays for itself:\nPerk Value Annual free night certificate $200+ 4th night free on award stays Varies Total $200+ 🆓 IHG One Rewards Traveler Credit Card The no-risk starting point.\nAnnual Fee $0 Sign-Up Bonus 80,000 points after $2,000 spend in 3 months Free Night None Status None If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure how often you\u0026rsquo;ll stay at IHG properties, this is a safe way to start earning points. 80,000 points for $2,000 in spending with no annual fee is solid.\nKey perks:\n💳 17x points at IHG properties 🍽️ 3x on dining, gas, and groceries 🌙 4th night free on award stays (yes, even with the no-fee card) Option 2: Chase Ultimate Rewards Transfer If you want more flexibility, Chase Ultimate Rewards points transfer 1:1 to IHG. This is my preferred approach because I can use the same points for flights, other hotels, or cash back if I need to.\nCards that earn transferable Ultimate Rewards:\nChase Sapphire Preferred Annual Fee $95 Sign-Up Bonus 60,000 points after $4,000 spend in 3 months 3x on dining, select streaming, and online groceries 2x on travel Points transfer to 14+ airline and hotel partners including IHG Chase Sapphire Reserve Annual Fee $550 Sign-Up Bonus 60,000 points after $4,000 spend in 3 months 3x on dining and travel $300 annual travel credit (effectively reduces fee to $250) Priority Pass lounge access Points worth 1.5x when booked through Chase Travel 💡 Pro tip: If you already have a Sapphire card for travel, you don\u0026rsquo;t need an IHG card. Just transfer points when you find a Kimpton you want to book. Transfers are instant.\nHow Many Points Do Kimpton Stays Cost? IHG uses dynamic pricing, so point costs vary by property, date, and demand. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen:\nDemand Points/Night Example Off-peak 20,000–35,000 Midweek in shoulder season Standard 40,000–60,000 Most weekends Peak 70,000–100,000+ Holidays, special events For reference, I searched Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver for a random February weekend and found award nights around 45,000 points. Paid rates were $280/night, so that\u0026rsquo;s solid value.\nRemember: If you have the IHG Premier card, book 4 nights and the 4th is free. That 180,000-point booking becomes 135,000.\nBest Kimpton Properties for Dog Travelers Not every Kimpton is equal when it comes to dog-friendliness (location matters). Here are some I\u0026rsquo;ve researched or have on my list:\n🏔️ Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver Downtown location with easy access to trails. The wine hour is popular, and staff are known for going above and beyond for pets. Close to Cherry Creek Dog Park.\n🌳 Kimpton Brice Hotel (Savannah) Enclosed courtyard that\u0026rsquo;s perfect for the evening wine reception with your pup. Walking distance to Forsyth Park — one of the most dog-friendly parks in the South.\n🌴 Kimpton Rowan Palm Springs Near several dog parks and surrounded by pet-friendly restaurant patios. Great for a desert getaway when it\u0026rsquo;s not 115°F.\n🏔️ Kimpton Arras (Asheville) Gateway to Blue Ridge Mountains hiking. Asheville is extremely dog-friendly, with tons of outdoor dining and brewery patios that welcome dogs.\n🍺 Kimpton Journeyman (Milwaukee) Dedicated pet-friendly floors. Good urban location for exploring with your dog.\nWhich Card Should You Get? You\u0026hellip; Get This Why 🆕 New to points IHG Traveler 80k bonus, no fee, no risk 🏨 Stay at IHG often IHG Premier 140k bonus, free night, 4th night free ✈️ Want flexibility Chase Sapphire Preferred Transfer to IHG + 13 other partners 💎 Already have Hilton cards Chase Sapphire Preferred Add IHG as a transfer option If you\u0026rsquo;re already in the Hilton ecosystem (like me), the Sapphire Preferred is a good complement. You keep your Hilton setup for most trips and transfer Chase points to IHG when you want to book a Kimpton.\nThe Bottom Line Kimpton is the best hotel chain for pet travelers, full stop. No other major brand matches their policy — no fees, no weight limits, no breed restrictions, and actual pet amenities beyond a sad bowl at the front desk.\nThe only downside is price. Kimpton properties aren\u0026rsquo;t cheap. But that\u0026rsquo;s exactly why points matter here. A $300/night boutique hotel stay feels very different when it costs you 45,000 points you earned from everyday spending.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a large dog and want a stress-free check-in experience, Kimpton should be on your radar. And now you know how to book it free.\nHave you stayed at a Kimpton with your dog? I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear which property — reach out and let me know.\nRead next: Best Credit Cards for Pet Travelers | Traveling with a Large Dog: Hotel Policies You Need to Know\n",

  "url": "http://localhost:1313/posts/jacksonville-to-panama-city-beach-road-trip/",
  "content": "The drive from Jacksonville to Panama City Beach is about 5-7 hours depending on how many stops you make — and if you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a dog, you\u0026rsquo;re going to make a lot of stops. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I learned driving this route with Ansel, my 70-pound GSP/Lab mix.\n(Planning a PCB trip? Check out my full Embassy Suites Panama City Beach review for the hotel details.)\nThe Route From Jacksonville (I started in Callahan), you\u0026rsquo;ll take I-10 West through Lake City, Tallahassee, and then head south on US-231 into Panama City Beach. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly highway driving with plenty of rest areas along the way.\nDistance: ~350 miles\nDrive time: 5-7 hours (with dog stops)\nBest Stops Along the Way The Must-Stop: Busy Bee If you only make one non-potty stop, make it Busy Bee. It\u0026rsquo;s basically Florida\u0026rsquo;s answer to Buc-ee\u0026rsquo;s — spotless restrooms (seriously, some of the cleanest gas station bathrooms you\u0026rsquo;ll ever see), a huge selection of snacks, jerky, fudge, and their famous Bee Bites. There\u0026rsquo;s also a Burger King and Dunkin\u0026rsquo; inside if you need real food.\nThere are two locations on I-10:\nLive Oak (Exit 283) — about 1.5 hours from Jacksonville Lake City (US-41 near I-75) — slightly earlier if you\u0026rsquo;re coming from the Callahan area Both have plenty of room to walk your dog around before heading back on the road. It\u0026rsquo;s worth the stop.\nRest Areas Florida\u0026rsquo;s I-10 rest areas are well-maintained with grassy pet areas:\nSuwannee County Rest Area (Mile Marker 294) — Good first stop Madison County Rest Area (Mile Marker 265) — Midway point Leon County Rest Area (Mile Marker 194) — Just west of Tallahassee All have pet areas, restrooms, and vending machines. Nothing fancy, but they get the job done.\nComing Soon: Buc-ee\u0026rsquo;s Buc-ee\u0026rsquo;s is building a massive 75,000 square foot location near Tallahassee on I-10. Once that opens, it\u0026rsquo;ll be another great option. For now, Busy Bee has you covered.\nWhat I Packed (And What I\u0026rsquo;d Do Differently) What Worked Backseat cover — Non-negotiable. Keeps the car clean and gives your dog a non-slip surface. Travel water bottle with attached bowl — Perfect for rest stops without digging through bags. Extra poop bags — I always overpack. Running out at a rest area is not ideal. His favorite blanket — Familiar smells help anxious dogs settle. (For my full packing list, check out road trip essentials for traveling with your dog.)\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;d Do Differently: The Crate Situation I made the mistake of bringing Ansel\u0026rsquo;s wire crate to use in the hotel room. The problem? It rattled the entire drive. Every bump, every turn — rattle, rattle, rattle. Ansel is an anxious boy when it comes to weird sounds, so by the time we arrived, he was stressed and I was frustrated.\nThe fix: Get a crash-tested travel kennel that stays in the car.\nThe two best options:\nGunner Kennel — The gold standard. 5-star crash test rating from the Center for Pet Safety, double-wall construction for temperature regulation, and built like a tank. For a 70-lb dog, you\u0026rsquo;d want the Large. They\u0026rsquo;re pricey (~$500+) and heavy (~72 lbs), but if safety is your priority, this is it.\nRuffland Kennel — The more budget-friendly option (~$300-350). Single-piece roto-molded plastic, lighter weight, and performed well in crash testing when secured against the seatback. A lot of hunters and dog sport people swear by these.\nEither way, your dog rides safer and you skip the rattling nightmare. I\u0026rsquo;m upgrading before my next trip.\nTiming Tips Leave early. If you leave Jacksonville by 7am, you can be in PCB by early afternoon with plenty of stops. Plan for stops every 2 hours — or whenever your dog tells you it\u0026rsquo;s time. Avoid Tallahassee rush hour if possible (typically 4-6pm). The last hour (US-231 south into PCB) is the slowest part — two-lane roads and beach traffic. The Bottom Line This is an easy drive if you plan for it. Pack smart, stop at Busy Bee, and invest in a proper travel crate. Your dog (and your sanity) will thank you.\nReady to book the hotel?

  "title": "Traveling with a Large Dog: Hotel Policies You Need to Know",
  "url": "http://localhost:1313/posts/traveling-with-large-dogs-hotel-policies/",
  "content": "When you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a small dog, finding pet-friendly hotels is pretty straightforward. But once your pup crosses that 50-pound threshold? Suddenly half your options disappear.\nI travel with Ansel, my 70-pound German Shorthaired Pointer/Lab mix. He\u0026rsquo;s a lanky, well-behaved sweetheart—but on paper, he\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;too big\u0026rdquo; for a lot of hotels. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the same boat with your large dog, here\u0026rsquo;s everything I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about navigating hotel weight limits.\nThe Weight Limit Problem Most hotel chains set their pet weight limits between 50-75 pounds. The logic seems to be liability and room size, but the limits often feel arbitrary. A calm 80-pound Lab is going to cause fewer issues than a hyper 30-pound terrier, but policies don\u0026rsquo;t account for temperament.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;ll typically see:\nUnder 50 lbs: Welcome almost everywhere 50-75 lbs: Many options, but you\u0026rsquo;ll need to check policies 75+ lbs: Options get limited fast The good news? Several hotel chains have no weight limits at all, and others are more flexible than their official policies suggest.\nHotels with NO Weight Limits These chains welcome dogs of any size—no awkward conversations at check-in required.\nKimpton Hotels The gold standard for large dog travel. Their unofficial motto is \u0026ldquo;if they fit through the door, they\u0026rsquo;re welcome.\u0026rdquo; They\u0026rsquo;ve hosted everything from Great Danes to llamas. No pet fee, no weight limit, and many properties have a resident \u0026ldquo;Director of Pet Relations\u0026rdquo; (a very good dog). The nightly wine reception often welcomes pups too.\nBest for: Travelers who want a boutique experience and don\u0026rsquo;t mind paying more per night.\nMotel 6 / Studio 6 The most budget-friendly option for large dogs. No pet fee at Motel 6, and no weight or breed restrictions. Studio 6 (their extended stay brand) charges around $10/night but still has no size limit.\nBest for: Road trippers who need affordable, no-questions-asked pet lodging.\nLa Quinta La Quinta used to be the holy grail—no pet fee and no weight limit. Since Wyndham acquired them, policies vary more by location. Many still have no restrictions, but some now cap at 75 pounds with a $25/night fee. Always call ahead to confirm.\nBest for: Frequent travelers who want consistency and don\u0026rsquo;t mind calling to verify.\nRed Roof Inn No weight limit, no breed restrictions, and no pet fee. They also provide designated dog walk areas with waste bags at each location. A solid budget option that genuinely welcomes large dogs.\nBest for: Budget road trips where you want a pet-friendly guarantee.\nLoews Hotels All 24 Loews properties accept dogs of any size. The \u0026ldquo;Loews Loves Pets\u0026rdquo; program provides beds, bowls, treats, and even a room service menu for dogs. Fees vary by property but are typically reasonable for the upscale experience.\nBest for: Special occasions when you want to treat yourself and your pup.\nSonesta (All Brands) Royal Sonesta, Sonesta Hotels, Sonesta Select, Sonesta ES Suites, and Sonesta Simply Suites all allow pets with no breed or size limit. Standard fee is $75 per stay (or $150 for stays over 7 nights).\nBest for: Extended stays and business travel with your dog.\nHotels with 75-80 lb Limits If your dog is in the 50-80 pound range, these chains will likely work:\nChain Weight Limit Pet Fee Notes Best Western 80 lbs per dog ~$30/night Policies vary by location Drury Hotels 80 lbs combined $50/night Up to 2 pets Candlewood Suites 80 lbs $75-150/stay IHG property My Place Hotels 80 lbs $15-30/night Midwest-focused chain Extended Stay America 36\u0026quot; x 36\u0026quot; Varies Measures by size, not weight! Pro tip: Extended Stay America measures dogs by dimensions rather than weight. If your dog is under 36 inches tall and 36 inches long, you\u0026rsquo;re good—that covers most large breeds except giant breeds.\nWhat About Hilton? Since I focus a lot on Hilton for points travel, here\u0026rsquo;s the reality: most Hilton brands cap at 50-75 pounds, and it varies by property.\nHilton brands that tend to be more flexible:\nHome2 Suites (75 lb limit) Hilton Garden Inn (75 lb limit at most locations) Homewood Suites (75 lb limit) DoubleTree (varies widely—some have no limit) Canopy by Hilton (very pet-friendly, 50-75 lbs) Always call the specific property before booking. The website might say 50 pounds, but the front desk often has discretion—especially for well-behaved dogs.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re earning Hilton points for pet travel, check out my Hilton credit card quiz to find the right card for your travel style.\nTips for When Your Dog Exceeds the Limit Here\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from traveling with a dog who\u0026rsquo;s technically \u0026ldquo;too big\u0026rdquo; for some policies:\n1. Call the hotel directly Don\u0026rsquo;t just book online and hope for the best. Call the front desk, explain your dog\u0026rsquo;s size and temperament, and ask if they can accommodate you. Many hotels will say yes even if the official policy says no—they care more about behavior than the number on the scale.\n2. Be honest Don\u0026rsquo;t lie about your dog\u0026rsquo;s weight. If you show up with an obviously-larger-than-stated dog, you risk being turned away. Honesty builds trust and often gets you further than trying to sneak by.\n3. Mention good behavior \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s 70 pounds but very calm and well-trained\u0026rdquo; goes a long way. Hotels worry about noise complaints and damage—if you can reassure them your dog won\u0026rsquo;t cause issues, they\u0026rsquo;re more likely to flex on the weight limit.\n4. Offer a larger deposit If a hotel is hesitant, offering to put down a larger refundable deposit can ease their concerns. It shows you\u0026rsquo;re confident in your dog\u0026rsquo;s behavior.\n5. Book pet-friendly room types Some hotels have designated pet rooms that can accommodate larger dogs. Ask specifically about these when you call.\n6. Use BringFido BringFido is the best resource for finding genuinely pet-friendly hotels. They verify policies and can even help negotiate weight limit exceptions through their Canine Concierge service.\n7. Use the Hotel Pet Policy Finder Not sure about a specific chain\u0026rsquo;s policy? Use my Hotel Pet Policy Finder to quickly check weight limits and fees for any major hotel brand.\nThe Reality Check Hotels rarely actually weigh dogs. Most front desk staff will eyeball your pup and decide if they\u0026rsquo;re comfortable. A well-groomed, calm dog on a leash makes a much better impression than a dog that\u0026rsquo;s pulling and barking—regardless of size.\nThat said, don\u0026rsquo;t abuse this. If a hotel says 50 pounds and you show up with a 120-pound Mastiff, you\u0026rsquo;re putting the staff in an awkward position and potentially ruining it for other large-dog travelers.\nMy Go-To Strategy For road trips with Ansel, here\u0026rsquo;s my approach:\nFirst choice: La Quinta or Red Roof Inn (no restrictions, budget-friendly) If I want something nicer: Kimpton or Loews (splurge-worthy, genuinely welcoming) If using Hilton points: Home2 Suites or Homewood Suites (call ahead to confirm) Always: Call the specific property before booking to confirm they\u0026rsquo;ll welcome my 70-pound guy The Bottom Line Traveling with a large dog takes more planning, but it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely doable. The key is knowing which chains are genuinely welcoming versus which ones just tolerate pets. Stick with the no-weight-limit chains for stress-free bookings, and always call ahead when you\u0026rsquo;re unsure.\nYour big dog deserves adventures too. Don\u0026rsquo;t let arbitrary weight limits keep you home.\nHave a favorite hotel chain for large dogs?

  "content": "When I started traveling with Ansel, my 70-pound GSP/Lab mix, I quickly learned that not all hotel chains are created equal. Some properties say they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;pet-friendly\u0026rdquo; but hit you with breed restrictions, weight limits, or fees that make you feel like your dog isn\u0026rsquo;t actually welcome.\nHilton is different. Here\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s become my go-to for pet travel.\nEvery Hilton Brand Welcomes Dogs This is the big one. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re staying at a Hampton Inn on a road trip or splurging on a Waldorf Astoria for a special occasion, every Hilton brand in the U.S. accepts pets.\nThat consistency matters when you\u0026rsquo;re planning trips with a dog. No more calling ahead to individual properties hoping they\u0026rsquo;ll say yes. No more getting turned away at check-in because someone didn\u0026rsquo;t update the website.\nThe brands include:\nHampton Inn \u0026amp; Suites Hilton Garden Inn Home2 Suites Homewood Suites DoubleTree Embassy Suites Hilton Hotels \u0026amp; Resorts Canopy by Hilton Curio Collection Tapestry Collection Conrad Hotels Waldorf Astoria One caveat: Weight limits vary by property, typically ranging from 50-75 lbs. If you have a larger dog, always call ahead to confirm. Check out my guide to traveling with large dogs for more tips.\nPoints Are Easy to Earn Hilton points are some of the easiest hotel points to stack through everyday spending. With the right credit card, you can earn points on:\nGroceries (including all that dog food) Gas stations (road trip fuel-ups) Restaurants (dog-friendly patios count!) Vet bills and pet supplies Everything else I\u0026rsquo;ve booked multiple free nights at pet-friendly Hiltons without setting foot in a hotel — just from everyday spending on my Hilton credit card.\nNot sure which card is right for you? Take my quick quiz to find your perfect match.\nDiamond Status Makes Pet Travel Easier Hilton\u0026rsquo;s top-tier status, Diamond, comes with perks that are especially valuable when you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a dog:\nRoom upgrades — More space means more room for your pup to spread out. I\u0026rsquo;ve been upgraded to suites multiple times, and the extra square footage makes a huge difference with a 70-pound dog.\nLate checkout — Morning potty breaks, packing up dog gear, loading the car\u0026hellip; it all takes longer with a pet. Late checkout (often until 2pm) gives you breathing room.\nDaily food \u0026amp; beverage credit — Pet fees add up. Having your meals partially covered helps offset those costs.\nExecutive lounge access — A quiet spot to grab coffee or a snack, away from the chaos of the main lobby.\nThe best part? You don\u0026rsquo;t have to stay 60 nights a year to get Diamond. The Hilton Aspire card gives you automatic Diamond status just for having the card.\nPet Fees Are Reasonable Hilton pet fees typically range from $50-$95 per stay, depending on the brand and location. That\u0026rsquo;s middle-of-the-road for the industry — not the cheapest, but far from the worst offenders.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re booking on points, the pet fee is often your only out-of-pocket cost. I\u0026rsquo;ll happily pay $75 for a \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; hotel stay at a property I know will welcome my dog without hassle.\nMy Hilton Pet Travel Stack Here\u0026rsquo;s the setup I use for earning and booking pet-friendly Hilton stays:\nHilton Aspire Card — Automatic Diamond status, annual free night certificate, $400 resort credit Hilton Points — Earned from everyday spending, used for free nights 5th Night Free — Book 4 nights on points, get the 5th free (20% savings!) BringFido — For double-checking pet policies and weight limits at specific properties This combo has gotten me free stays at pet-friendly Embassy Suites, Hilton Garden Inns, and more — with Ansel welcome at every single one.\nReady to Start? If you\u0026rsquo;re new to Hilton points and want to start traveling free with your pup, here\u0026rsquo;s where to begin:\nTake the quiz to find the right Hilton credit card for your travel style Learn about Diamond status and why it\u0026rsquo;s worth pursuing Compare all the credit card options if you want the full breakdown Have questions? Reach out — I\u0026rsquo;m always happy to help fellow pet travelers figure out the points game.\nTraveling with a pup over 50 lbs? Read my guide to hotel policies for large dogs before you book.\n",

  "content": "Last month, Ansel and I made the drive from Jacksonville to Panama City Beach for a long weekend. I\u0026rsquo;d been eyeing the Embassy Suites by Hilton Panama City Beach Resort for a while — it\u0026rsquo;s pet-friendly, right across from the beach, and I had a stack of Hilton points burning a hole in my account. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it went.\nSomeone approved of the room upgrade.\nThe Booking I used my Hilton Honors American Express Surpass points plus a free night certificate to book this stay. I stayed for 5 nights — and here\u0026rsquo;s a tip: when you book 4 nights with points, the 5th night is free. That\u0026rsquo;s a 20% discount built right in.\nThe only thing I actually paid out of pocket? Tipping the valet. That\u0026rsquo;s it.\nPet fees: $75 for stays of 1-4 nights, or $125 for 5+ nights. They allow up to 2 pets, max 75 lbs each, dogs and cats only. No breed restrictions. Ansel is a 70-pound German Shorthaired Pointer/Lab mix, so he squeaked in under the limit.\nPro tip: If you have Hilton Diamond status, request a room upgrade when you book. I asked and got bumped to a king suite with an ocean view and a balcony. Ansel spent a solid 20 minutes every morning just watching the beach from up there.\n(New to points and hotel status? Check out my guide to the best credit cards for pet travelers and how Hilton Diamond status works.)\nThe Hotel: What You Need to Know The Embassy Suites PCB is located right by Pier Park, across the street from the beach. Not beachfront, but close enough that it\u0026rsquo;s a 5-minute walk to sand. In fact, everything we did — Dog Beach, Pier Park, Margaritaville — was within walking distance of the hotel. We barely moved the car all week.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing nobody tells you: there\u0026rsquo;s only one elevator.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a dog — especially a bigger one who needs to go out first thing in the morning — request a room close to the elevator. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think to ask, and our first morning involved a very long hallway walk with an increasingly urgent pup. Lesson learned.\nMaking himself at home.\nThe room itself was spacious (it\u0026rsquo;s a suite, so you get a separate living area), clean, and the balcony was a huge win. Ansel could hang out there while I got ready without feeling cooped up.\nThe hotel also has designated dog areas around the property with poop bag stations, so those early morning and late night potty breaks are easy.\nNote: Dogs are not allowed at the pool. If you want pool time, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to plan around it (more on that below).\nThe Beach The big draw here is Dog Beach — an exclusive dog beach right across from Pier Park. You can see the \u0026ldquo;Welcome to Dog Beach\u0026rdquo; sign from Margaritaville. It\u0026rsquo;s a short walk from the hotel.\nThe destination.\nFirst time touching PCB sand.\nThat Gulf water is unreal.\nDog-Friendly Dining One of the best parts of PCB is how many restaurants have dog-friendly patios — and most of them are walking distance from the hotel. We hit up Margaritaville — great views, Ansel got tons of attention, and they didn\u0026rsquo;t bat an eye at a 70-pound dog under the table.\nLunch with a view.\nHe was very well-behaved (mostly).\nExploring Pier Park Pier Park is a huge outdoor shopping area right next to the hotel — literally a few minutes walk. Lots of stores, restaurants, and photo ops. Ansel found his way onto a Ron Jon surfboard.\nSurfer pup.\nRoad Trip Essentials: What I Packed A few things that made the drive with a 70-pound dog way easier:\nBackseat cover — Protects the seats, gives Ansel a non-slip surface, and makes cleanup a breeze. Travel water bottle with bowl — Attaches right to a cup holder. Perfect for rest stops. Poop bags — I always overpack. Running out at a hotel is not the move. (For my full packing list, check out road trip essentials for traveling with your dog.)\nNeed a Break? Daycare \u0026amp; Grooming Options Sometimes you want to hit the pool or grab dinner somewhere that isn\u0026rsquo;t dog-friendly. Here are your options near the hotel:\nZOOMIES Pet Hotel — Full daycare, boarding, and grooming. Book ahead, especially on weekends. Dagny and Dexter\u0026rsquo;s — Another solid daycare option nearby. PetSmart in Pier Park — Right next door for grooming or supplies. I dropped Ansel off here for a grooming session so I could spend a few hours at the pool. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend booking daycare in advance if you know you\u0026rsquo;ll want pool time or want to explore without the dog for a day.\nThe Verdict This was a genuinely easy trip. The hotel is well-located for a dog-friendly beach weekend, the points redemption felt like good value, and Ansel had a blast.\nWould I go back? Yeah, probably. Next time I\u0026rsquo;ll be smarter about requesting a room near the elevator, and I\u0026rsquo;ll book daycare in advance so I can get more pool time.\nAnsel\u0026rsquo;s Rating: 4/5 Paws 🐾🐾🐾🐾 What he loved: The balcony. The beach. All the new smells at Pier Park.\nWhat he didn\u0026rsquo;t love: That long hallway walk at 6am.\nQuick Reference Detail Info Hotel Embassy Suites by Hilton Panama City Beach Resort Location Across from beach, next to Pier Park Pet Policy 2 pets max, 75 lbs each, dogs/cats only, no breed restrictions Pet Fee $75 (1-4 nights) or $125 (5+ nights) Points Used Hilton Honors (via Surpass card + free night cert) Out of Pocket Valet tip only Dog-Friendly Beach Dog Beach, walking distance Dog Areas On-site with poop bag stations Pool No dogs allowed — use grooming/daycare for pool time Grooming PetSmart in Pier Park Daycare ZOOMIES Pet Hotel, Dagny and Dexter\u0026rsquo;s (book ahead!)

  "title": "Road Trip Essentials for Traveling with Your Dog",
  "url": "http://localhost:1313/posts/road-trip-essentials-dogs/",
  "content": "I\u0026rsquo;ve done enough road trips with Ansel to know what\u0026rsquo;s actually worth packing — and what just takes up space. Here\u0026rsquo;s my go-to list for traveling with a 70-pound dog.\n🚗 Car Setup Seat cover — Non-negotiable. I use one in my 4Runner that covers the entire back seat, has flaps that protect the doors, and is waterproof. Saves your interior from muddy paws, sand, and the occasional drool puddle.\nCrash-tested crate — If your dog does better contained, a crate is the safest option. Brands like Gunner and Ruff Land are pricey but built to protect your dog in an accident. Worth it for peace of mind on long drives.\nCar barrier — If a crate doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit your setup, a barrier keeps them in the back without roaming into the front seat. Less secure than a crate, but better than nothing.\nSeat belt harness — Another safety option if you don\u0026rsquo;t use a crate. Clips into your seatbelt and keeps your dog secured. Look for crash-tested options.\n💧 Food \u0026amp; Water Travel water bottle with bowl attachment — This is the one thing I\u0026rsquo;d never skip. Mine has a bowl that screws onto the top, so I can give Ansel water at rest stops without digging through bags. Fits right in the cup holder.\nCollapsible bowls — Cheap, packable, and useful for food or water at the hotel. I keep a couple in my bag at all times.\nFood storage — I portion out food into ziplock bags or use a small airtight container. Keeps things simple and avoids lugging an entire bag of kibble.\n🛏️ Comfort Items Pet blanket — Ansel has a designated travel blanket. It smells like home, which helps him settle in unfamiliar hotel rooms. Also useful for covering hotel furniture if you\u0026rsquo;re worried about fur.\nFavorite toy — Something familiar to keep them occupied during downtime. Don\u0026rsquo;t bring anything too squeaky unless you want to hear it for 5 hours straight.\nTreats — For rewarding good behavior, training moments, and bribing them back into the car after a rest stop. I pack more than I think I\u0026rsquo;ll need.\n🧹 Safety \u0026amp; Cleanup Poop bags — I always overpack. Running out at a hotel or rest stop is not a situation you want to be in. Bring twice as many as you think you need.\nPet first aid kit — Basic stuff: bandages, antiseptic wipes, tweezers for ticks, Benadryl (ask your vet for dosage). You probably won\u0026rsquo;t need it, but you\u0026rsquo;ll be glad you have it.\nTowels — At least one or two. For wet paws, muddy adventures, post-beach shakeoffs, or unexpected messes. Old towels work great.\nLint roller — Your future self will thank you. Keep one in the car and one in your bag.\n📋 Documents Vaccination records — Some hotels ask for proof of rabies vaccination. Keep a copy on your phone or in the car. I take a photo of Ansel\u0026rsquo;s records so I always have them.\nID tags — Make sure your dog\u0026rsquo;s tags are up to date with your current phone number. Travel is the worst time for a tag with an old number.\nMicrochip info — Know your microchip number and make sure your contact info is current in the registry. Takes 5 minutes to check online.\n✅ The Quick Packing Checklist If you\u0026rsquo;re in a hurry, here\u0026rsquo;s the minimum:\nEssential Why 🚗 Seat cover Protect your car 💧 Water bottle with bowl Hydration at rest stops 💩 Poop bags (lots) Don\u0026rsquo;t run out 🛏️ Blanket Comfort + furniture protection 🦴 Treats Bribes work 🦮 Leash Obviously 📋 Vaccination records Hotels may ask Everything else is nice to have but not essential for a weekend trip.\n🐾 Where I\u0026rsquo;ve Used This Stuff Most recently, Ansel and I did 5 nights in Panama City Beach — about a 5-hour drive from Jacksonville. This packing list kept us covered the whole trip.\nThe seat cover handled sandy paws after the beach, the water bottle was a lifesaver at rest stops, and the blanket made the hotel room feel like home.\n🛒 My Gear Recommendations Here\u0026rsquo;s what I personally use:\nItem What I Use Notes Seat cover Waterproof hammock-style Covers doors too Water bottle Bottle with flip-up bowl Cup holder friendly Crate Gunner G1 Pricey but bombproof First aid kit Pre-made pet kit + Benadryl Check with your vet on dosage Blanket Travel fleece blanket Smells like home Have a road trip essential I missed? Let me know — I\u0026rsquo;m always looking to upgrade my setup.\nRead next: Best Pet-Friendly Beach Towns Near Jacksonville\n",

  "title": "Hilton Diamond Status: How to Get It and Why It's Worth It",
  "url": "http://localhost:1313/posts/hilton-diamond-status-guide/",
  "content": "Hilton Diamond is the top tier of Hilton Honors (until Diamond Reserve launches in 2026), and it comes with perks that make traveling with a dog way easier — room upgrades, late checkout, free breakfast, and more.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how I got it and why it\u0026rsquo;s worth pursuing.\n💎 How I Got Diamond Status I earned Diamond status two ways:\nFirst time: I hit the $40,000 spending threshold on my Hilton Surpass card through everyday spending — groceries, gas, dining, bills. Once you hit that number, Diamond status kicks in within a few weeks.\nNow: I carry the Hilton Aspire card, which gives you automatic Diamond status just for having the card. No spending threshold, no stays required — you\u0026rsquo;re Diamond from day one.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re serious about hotel travel, the Aspire is the easier path. If you\u0026rsquo;re already putting significant spend on a Surpass card, you might hit Diamond that way first.\n⭐ Diamond Status Benefits Here\u0026rsquo;s what you actually get:\nBenefit What It Means 🛏️ Room upgrades Up to 1-bedroom suites, based on availability 🍳 Daily food \u0026amp; beverage credit At U.S. properties (or free breakfast internationally) 🍸 Executive lounge access Free breakfast, snacks, drinks (where available) ⏰ Late checkout Sleep in, no rush 💯 100% bonus points Double the base points on every stay 🌙 5th night free Book 4 nights with points, get the 5th free 📶 Premium WiFi Fastest speeds in the hotel ✅ 48-hour room guarantee Guaranteed room if booked 48+ hours ahead 🎁 Welcome amenities Snacks, water bottles, treats at check-in (varies by property) 🏨 The Perks I Actually Use Room Upgrades This is the big one. As a Diamond member, I\u0026rsquo;ve been upgraded to suites multiple times — including an ocean-view suite at the Embassy Suites in Panama City Beach. More space means more room for the dog to spread out, and a balcony is a game-changer for morning coffee while Ansel watches the beach.\nPro tip: When you book, add a note requesting an upgrade. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee anything, but it puts you on their radar.\nDaily Food \u0026amp; Beverage Credit At most U.S. Hilton properties, Diamond members get a daily F\u0026amp;B credit instead of free breakfast. The amount varies by brand (usually $15–$25 per person), and it applies to you plus one guest.\n💡 Pro tip: These credits stack. Staying 3 nights? That\u0026rsquo;s 3 days of credits you can use whenever — save them up and have a nice dinner on your last night, or use them at the bar.\nLate Checkout When you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a dog, late checkout is clutch. No rushing to pack up and get the dog out by 11am. I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten 2pm checkout at most properties just by asking at the front desk.\nExecutive Lounge Access Where available, Diamond members can access the executive lounge for free breakfast, evening appetizers, and drinks. These are more common at international properties — in the U.S., they\u0026rsquo;re hit or miss. But when you find one, it\u0026rsquo;s a nice quiet spot to grab coffee or a snack.\nWelcome Amenities This varies by property, but I\u0026rsquo;ve received complimentary water bottles, snacks, and even treats for Ansel at check-in. Small touches that make you feel recognized.\n🎯 Ways to Earn Diamond Status Method Requirement 💳 Hilton Aspire card Automatic — just have the card 💳 Hilton Surpass card Spend $40,000 in a calendar year 🛏️ Stays 30 stays in a calendar year 🌙 Nights 60 nights in a calendar year ⭐ Base points Earn 120,000 base points in a calendar year For most people, the credit card path is the easiest. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re traveling for work constantly, hitting 60 nights is tough. But everyday spending on a Surpass or Aspire card? That adds up fast.\n💳 The Credit Card Shortcut Hilton Aspire ($550/year) Automatic Diamond status — no spend required Annual free night certificate $400/year in Hilton resort credits $200/year in flight credits (buy airline gift cards — they count!) 175,000 point sign-up bonus Hilton Surpass ($150/year) Gold status automatic, Diamond at $40k spend $200/year in Hilton credits ($50/quarter — use at any Hilton property, even just for dinner) Free night after $15k spend 155,000 point sign-up bonus If you want Diamond without the $550 Aspire fee, the Surpass path works — it just takes more spending. I did it for a couple years before upgrading to the Aspire.\nFor the full breakdown, check out my Best Credit Cards for Pet Travelers guide.\n🌙 Free Night Certificates: The Secret Weapon One of my favorite Diamond perks isn\u0026rsquo;t technically a Diamond perk — it\u0026rsquo;s the free night certificates from the Aspire card. But here\u0026rsquo;s what most people don\u0026rsquo;t realize:\nThese certificates work at almost any Hilton property.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve used mine at resorts where rooms go for $400–$500/night. Some people have used them at properties charging $1,000+ per night. The certificate covers one standard night, regardless of the cash price.\nSo while you\u0026rsquo;re earning Diamond status and racking up points, those free night certificates are quietly saving you hundreds of dollars per year.\n🐕 Why Diamond Matters for Pet Travelers Here\u0026rsquo;s why I think Diamond status is especially valuable when you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a dog:\nSuite upgrades = more space. A regular hotel room with a 70-pound dog feels cramped. A suite with a separate living area? Much better.\nLate checkout = less stress. Morning potty breaks, packing up dog gear, loading the car — it all takes longer with a pet. Late checkout gives you breathing room.\nF\u0026amp;B credits = save money. Pet fees add up. Having your meals partially covered helps offset those costs.\nWelcome amenities. Some properties include dog treats or pet welcome packages for Diamond members. It\u0026rsquo;s not guaranteed, but it happens.\n📅 What\u0026rsquo;s Coming: Diamond Reserve (2026) Hilton is adding a new tier above Diamond starting January 2026 — Diamond Reserve. It requires 80 nights or 40 stays PLUS $18,000 in eligible spend.\nThe perks include confirmable suite upgrades at booking, guaranteed 4pm late checkout, and 120% bonus points. For most travelers, regular Diamond will still be the goal — but it\u0026rsquo;s good to know what\u0026rsquo;s coming.\nThe good news: nothing changes for current Diamond members. All the existing benefits stay the same.\n✅ The Bottom Line Diamond status makes hotel travel more comfortable — especially with a dog. The upgrades, late checkout, and F\u0026amp;B credits add real value, and the credit card path makes it accessible even if you\u0026rsquo;re not a road warrior.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re already staying at Hilton properties and putting spend on a Hilton card, Diamond is within reach. And once you have it, you\u0026rsquo;ll wonder how you traveled without it.\nHave questions about earning or using Diamond status?

It depends. How often do you travel, which hotel brands do you like, and how much do you spend on everyday stuff? There\u0026rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all answer, but I\u0026rsquo;m happy to help you figure it out. Check out my credit card guide first, then shoot me a message if you still have questions.\n\u0026ldquo;Can I send you free stuff?\u0026rdquo;\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s relevant to pet travel — gear, products, hotel stays — I\u0026rsquo;m open to it.

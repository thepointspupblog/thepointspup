[{"content":"If you travel with your dog and aren\u0026rsquo;t using hotel credit cards, you\u0026rsquo;re leaving money on the table. Pet fees, room rates, and all those extras add up fast — but the right cards can offset most of it with points, free nights, and elite status perks.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I use and recommend for dog travelers.\nDisclosure: This post contains affiliate links. If you apply for a card through my links, I may earn a commission at no extra cost to you. See my full disclosure for details. Jump to:\nWhy Hotel Cards Make Sense The Hilton Combo Hilton Aspire Hilton Surpass Hilton No Fee For Kimpton: IHG \u0026amp; Chase Marriott Alternative Which Card Should You Get? Why Hotel Cards Make Sense for Dog Owners Most dog-friendly hotels charge $50–$150 per stay in pet fees. You can\u0026rsquo;t avoid those (yet), but you can make the room itself free by booking with points. And with elite status, you get perks like room upgrades, late checkout, and free breakfast — all of which make traveling with a dog way easier.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t paid for a hotel room in years. I use Hilton points from my credit cards, and the free night certificates cover the rest.\nMy Setup: The Hilton Combo I\u0026rsquo;m loyal to Hilton because their pet policies are solid (most properties allow dogs up to 75 lbs with no breed restrictions), and their credit cards are some of the best in the game.\n💎 Hilton Honors American Express Aspire The premium option for serious travelers.\nAnnual Fee $550 Status Diamond (top tier) Sign-Up Bonus 175,000 points after $6,000 spend in 6 months Free Nights 1/year, plus more at $30k and $60k spend This is the card if you\u0026rsquo;re serious about hotel travel. Diamond status gets you room upgrades, executive lounge access, and late checkout — all super helpful when traveling with a dog.\nThat 175,000-point bonus alone is worth around 2–3 free nights at most Hilton properties. Combined with the annual free night certificate, you could have a week\u0026rsquo;s worth of hotel stays from day one.\nKey perks:\n✈️ Up to $200/year in flight credits ($50/quarter) 🏨 Up to $400/year in Hilton resort credits ($200 every 6 months) 🚀 Up to $209/year CLEAR credit 🛎️ $100 credit at Waldorf Astoria and Conrad properties 💳 14x points at Hilton, 7x on dining and flights, 3x everything else 💡 Pro tip: You don\u0026rsquo;t have to book flights to use the flight credit. Buy airline gift cards or add funds to your travel bank (Delta, Southwest, etc.) — they count toward the credit and don\u0026rsquo;t expire for 5 years. Easy way to bank the $200 even if you\u0026rsquo;re not flying soon.\nHow the $550 fee pays for itself:\nPerk Value Annual free night certificate $300+ Hilton resort credits $400 Flight credits $200 CLEAR credit $209 Total $1,100+ Even if you only use half of these, you\u0026rsquo;re coming out ahead.\n🥇 Hilton Honors American Express Surpass The sweet spot for most dog travelers.\nAnnual Fee $150 Status Gold (Diamond at $40k/year spend) Sign-Up Bonus 155,000 points after $3,000 spend in 6 months Free Nights 1 after $15k spend in a calendar year This is the sweet spot for most travelers. Gold status gets you the 5th night free on award stays, plus a daily food \u0026amp; beverage credit or free breakfast at most properties.\nThe sign-up bonus is easier to hit than the Aspire ($3k vs $6k), and 155,000 points is still enough for multiple free nights.\nKey perks:\n🏨 Up to $200/year in Hilton credits ($50/quarter) 💳 12x points at Hilton, 6x on dining/groceries/gas, 3x everything else 🌙 Free night after $15k spend 💡 Pro tip: The quarterly $50 credit works on any purchase at a Hilton property — you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a guest. Grab dinner or drinks at a Hilton restaurant near you, and you\u0026rsquo;ve used your credit. Do that 4 times a year and you\u0026rsquo;ve made back more than the annual fee.\nHow the $150 fee pays for itself:\nPerk Value Quarterly Hilton credits $200 Total $200 Just by using the $50 quarterly credit, you\u0026rsquo;re $50 ahead before you even count the points you\u0026rsquo;re earning. If you hit the $15k spend for the free night certificate, that\u0026rsquo;s another $200+ in value.\nI carry both the Aspire and Surpass. Between them, I get 2–3 free night certificates per year, plus enough points from everyday spending to cover several more nights.\n🆓 Hilton Honors American Express (No Annual Fee) The risk-free starting point.\nAnnual Fee $0 Status Silver Sign-Up Bonus 100,000 points after $2,000 spend in 6 months Free Nights None If you\u0026rsquo;re just getting started, this is a no-risk way to begin earning Hilton points. You won\u0026rsquo;t get a free night certificate, but you still get the 5th night free benefit on award stays, which is a 20% discount on any points redemption of 5+ nights.\n100,000 points for just $2,000 in spending — with no annual fee — is one of the best entry points into hotel rewards.\nKey perks:\n💳 7x points at Hilton, 5x on dining/groceries/gas, 3x everything else 🆓 No annual fee 🌙 5th night free on award stays For Kimpton Travelers: IHG \u0026amp; Chase Cards Kimpton has the best pet policy in the industry — no fees, no weight limits, no breed restrictions. If that\u0026rsquo;s your priority, you\u0026rsquo;ll need IHG points (Kimpton is part of IHG).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t carry these cards yet, but they\u0026rsquo;re worth considering if Kimpton is your target.\n🏨 IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card Best if you\u0026rsquo;ll stay at IHG/Kimpton regularly.\nAnnual Fee $99 Sign-Up Bonus 140,000 points after $3,000 spend in 3 months Free Night 1/year (up to 40,000 points) Status Platinum Elite That 140,000-point bonus is enough for 2-4 free nights at most Kimptons.\nKey perks:\n💳 26x points at IHG properties 🌙 4th night free on award stays (book 4, pay for 3) 🎁 Annual free night certificate How the $99 fee pays for itself:\nPerk Value Annual free night certificate $200+ Total $200+ 🆓 IHG One Rewards Traveler Credit Card The no-risk IHG option.\nAnnual Fee $0 Sign-Up Bonus 80,000 points after $2,000 spend in 3 months Free Night None If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure how often you\u0026rsquo;ll stay at Kimpton/IHG, this gets you started with no commitment.\nKey perks:\n💳 17x points at IHG properties 🍽️ 3x on dining, gas, and groceries 🌙 4th night free on award stays (yes, even with the no-fee card) 💳 Chase Sapphire Preferred Best for flexibility across multiple hotel programs.\nAnnual Fee $95 Sign-Up Bonus 60,000 points after $4,000 spend in 3 months Chase Ultimate Rewards points transfer 1:1 to IHG — and to Hyatt, Marriott, and 10+ airline partners. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to commit to one hotel chain, this is the move.\nKey perks:\n💳 3x on dining, select streaming, and online groceries ✈️ 2x on travel 🔄 Points transfer to 14+ airline and hotel partners 💡 Pro tip: If you already have Hilton cards and want to add Kimpton as an option, the Sapphire Preferred is a good complement. Transfer to IHG when you find a Kimpton you want, keep your Hilton setup for everything else.\nFull breakdown: How to Book Kimpton Free with Points\nThe Alternative: Marriott 🏨 Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Best for Marriott loyalists.\nAnnual Fee $95 Status Silver Elite (Gold at $35k/year spend) Sign-Up Bonus 3 free nights (each up to 50,000 points) after $3,000 spend in 3 months Free Nights 1/year (up to 35,000 points, can top off with 15k more) That sign-up bonus is huge — 3 free nights at properties up to 50,000 points each. That could cover a long weekend at a solid Marriott property right out of the gate.\nKey perks:\n💳 Up to 17x points at Marriott properties 🍽️ 3x on dining, groceries, and gas (first $6k/year) 🌙 Annual free night certificate ⭐ 15 Elite Night Credits per year How the $95 fee pays for itself:\nPerk Value Annual free night certificate $200+ Total $200+ The free night certificate alone is worth at least double the annual fee at most Marriott properties. You can also top it off with up to 15,000 additional points to book nicer hotels.\nMarriott\u0026rsquo;s pet policies vary more by property than Hilton\u0026rsquo;s, so always check before booking. Some Marriott brands (like Residence Inn and TownePlace Suites) tend to be more consistently dog-friendly.\nWhich Card Should You Get?

The right credit cards won\u0026rsquo;t eliminate pet fees, but they can make the room free — and that\u0026rsquo;s a huge win.\nThe annual fees on these cards look scary at first, but once you factor in the credits and free nights, most of them pay you back more than you put in. Start with whichever card fits your budget and travel frequency, and build from there.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been running this setup for years, and it\u0026rsquo;s saved me thousands.

The 155,000-point bonus is enough for 3-5 free nights at most dog-friendly Hilton properties. You also get:\nAutomatic Gold status (80% bonus points on stays) Up to $200/year in Hilton statement credits 10 free nights toward Diamond status Path to Diamond if you spend $40k/year Why it\u0026rsquo;s great for dog travel: Every Hilton brand welcomes dogs with no breed restrictions, and most have no weight limits. Gold status gets you late checkout — crucial when you need extra time for that morning dog walk.\nMy take: This is the card I recommend most. The bonus is high, the fee is reasonable, and Hilton\u0026rsquo;s footprint means you\u0026rsquo;ll always find a dog-friendly option.\n💎 Premium Pick: Hilton Aspire Bonus: 175,000 Hilton Honors points after $6,000 spend in 6 months\nAnnual fee: $550\nOffer expires: January 14, 2026\nThe Aspire is Hilton\u0026rsquo;s top-tier card, and 175,000 points is a solid bonus (though we\u0026rsquo;ve seen it higher).

Jump to:\nThe Short Answer Pet Fees by Brand Weight Limits Most Dog-Friendly Brands Booking Tips How to Stay Free The Short Answer Does Hilton allow pets? Yes — all Hilton brands in the U.S. accept dogs.\nHow much is the pet fee? Typically $50–$95 per stay (not per night), but varies by brand and location.\nIs there a weight limit? Usually 75 lbs, but some properties cap at 50 lbs. Always call ahead.\nBreed restrictions? No official breed restrictions at the corporate level, though individual properties may have their own policies.\nHilton Pet Fees by Brand Pet fees vary by brand and location. Here\u0026rsquo;s what to expect:\nBrand Typical Pet Fee Notes Hampton Inn $50–$75/stay Budget-friendly, consistent policies Hilton Garden Inn $50–$75/stay Good for business travel with dogs Home2 Suites $50–$75/stay Extended stay, kitchen in room Homewood Suites $75–$100/stay Suite-style, great for longer trips Tru by Hilton $50–$75/stay Budget option, newer properties DoubleTree $50–$75/stay Varies widely by location Embassy Suites $75–$95/stay All suites, separate living area Hilton Hotels \u0026amp; Resorts $75–$95/stay Full-service properties Canopy by Hilton $50–$75/stay Boutique brand, very pet-friendly Curio Collection Varies Boutique, check specific property Tapestry Collection Varies Boutique, check specific property Conrad Hotels $100+/stay Luxury brand, higher fees Waldorf Astoria $100+/stay Luxury brand, higher fees Important: These are typical ranges. Always confirm the exact fee when booking — some high-demand locations charge more.\nWeight Limits by Brand Most Hilton brands cap pets at 75 lbs, but this varies by property:\nBrand Typical Weight Limit Hampton Inn 75 lbs Hilton Garden Inn 75 lbs Home2 Suites 75 lbs Homewood Suites 75 lbs Tru by Hilton 75 lbs DoubleTree 50–75 lbs (varies) Embassy Suites 75 lbs Hilton Hotels 50–75 lbs (varies) Canopy by Hilton 50–75 lbs Curio Collection Varies by property Tapestry Collection Varies by property Conrad Hotels Varies by property Waldorf Astoria Varies by property If your dog is over 75 lbs: Call the property directly before booking. Some locations are flexible, especially for well-behaved dogs. Others are strict. Don\u0026rsquo;t risk showing up and getting turned away.\nHave a large dog? Check out Kimpton hotels — they have NO weight limits and NO pet fees.\nMost Dog-Friendly Hilton Brands If you\u0026rsquo;re specifically looking for the best Hilton experience with your dog, these brands consistently deliver:\nHome2 Suites ⭐ Best Overall Every room has a kitchen (store dog food, prep meals) Spacious layouts with separate areas Usually ground-floor rooms available Consistent 75 lb weight limit Often near outdoor spaces Homewood Suites ⭐ Best for Extended Stays Full kitchens in every suite Separate living and sleeping areas Evening social hours (free food!) Great for longer road trips Embassy Suites ⭐ Best for Space Every room is a suite with separate living room Made-to-order breakfast included Evening reception with drinks and snacks More room for your dog to spread out Canopy by Hilton ⭐ Most Pet-Friendly Vibe Boutique brand with local character Staff genuinely welcoming to dogs Often in walkable neighborhoods Sometimes have treats at check-in Tips for Booking Hilton with Your Dog 1. Always Call the Property Online booking shows \u0026ldquo;pet-friendly,\u0026rdquo; but doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell you the weight limit or fee. A 2-minute call confirms:\nExact pet fee Weight limit at that location Any breed restrictions Pet relief areas on property 2. Request a Ground Floor Room Ask for a room near an exit for easy potty breaks. First-floor rooms near a side door are ideal — you can slip out for late-night walks without trekking through the lobby.\n3. Add a Note to Your Reservation When booking online, add a note that you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a dog. Include the breed and weight. This flags your reservation so the front desk is prepared.\n4. Bring Documentation Keep your dog\u0026rsquo;s vaccination records handy. Some properties ask for proof of rabies vaccination at check-in.\n5. Know the Rules Most Hilton properties require:\nDogs must be on leash in public areas Dogs cannot be left unattended in rooms (or must be crated) You\u0026rsquo;re responsible for any damage No dogs in pool, fitness center, or restaurant areas How to Book Hilton Free with Points Pet fees are unavoidable, but the room itself can be free. I use Hilton credit cards to earn points on everyday spending, then book award nights at pet-friendly properties.\nThe math: A typical Hilton stay costs 30,000–60,000 points per night. The Hilton Surpass card has a 155,000-point sign-up bonus — enough for 2-5 free nights right out of the gate.\nMy approach:\nEarn Hilton points from a credit card (groceries, gas, dining all count) Book award nights at pet-friendly properties Pay only the pet fee out of pocket A $200/night room + $75 pet fee becomes just $75. Much easier to stomach.\nNot sure which card? Take the quiz to find the best Hilton card for your travel style.\nHilton Elite Status \u0026amp; Pet Travel Elite status makes traveling with a dog easier:\nBenefit Why It Matters for Dog Owners Room upgrades More space for your pup Late checkout Extra time for morning walks 5th night free 20% off longer stays F\u0026amp;B credit (Diamond) Offset pet fee costs Gold status comes free with the Hilton Surpass card. Diamond status comes free with the Hilton Aspire card — or by spending $40k/year on the Surpass.\nLearn more: Hilton Diamond Status: How to Get It and Why It\u0026rsquo;s Worth It\nFrequently Asked Questions Can I bring 2 dogs to Hilton? Most Hilton properties allow up to 2 pets. The weight limit usually applies per pet (so two 50-lb dogs may be fine, but two 75-lb dogs might exceed the limit). Always confirm with the specific property.\nAre there breed restrictions at Hilton? Hilton doesn\u0026rsquo;t have corporate breed restrictions, but individual properties (especially in certain cities or states) may restrict certain breeds due to local laws or insurance requirements. Call ahead if you have a pit bull, Rottweiler, or other commonly restricted breed.\nCan I leave my dog alone in the room? Policies vary. Some properties require dogs to be crated if left alone. Others don\u0026rsquo;t allow pets to be left unattended at all. Ask at check-in to avoid problems.\nWhat if my dog damages the room? You\u0026rsquo;ll be charged for any damage. Most properties take a credit card on file. Be honest about damage — trying to hide it makes things worse.\nDoes Hilton provide pet amenities? Some properties offer beds, bowls, or treats. It\u0026rsquo;s not guaranteed, so bring your own supplies. Canopy by Hilton is known for having treats at check-in.\nThe Bottom Line Hilton is one of the most reliable hotel chains for dog owners. Every brand accepts pets, policies are fairly consistent, and their footprint means you\u0026rsquo;ll find a pet-friendly option almost anywhere.\nThe key is confirming details with each property before you book — weight limits and fees vary, and a quick phone call prevents surprises at check-in.\nAnd if you\u0026rsquo;re paying for hotels anyway, consider earning Hilton points through a credit card. The pet fee is a lot easier to swallow when the room is free.\nRead next: Why Hilton Is the Best Hotel Chain for Pet Travelers | Best Credit Cards for Pet Travelers | Quiz: Which Hilton Card Is Right for You?\n","date":"2025-12-10T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/hilton-pet-policy-2025/","title":"Hilton Pet Policy 2025: Fees, Weight Limits \u0026 What to Know Before You Book"},{"content":"If you\u0026rsquo;ve been following along, you know I\u0026rsquo;m obsessed with Hilton for dog travel. But here\u0026rsquo;s the thing: IHG has a secret weapon that even Hilton can\u0026rsquo;t match.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s called Kimpton.\nKimpton is hands-down the most dog-friendly hotel brand in existence. No weight limits. No breed restrictions. No pet fees. Ever. They\u0026rsquo;ll welcome your Great Dane the same way they\u0026rsquo;d welcome a Chihuahua.\nBut Kimpton is just one piece of the IHG puzzle. Let me break down the entire IHG portfolio so you know exactly where you can (and can\u0026rsquo;t) bring your dog.\nThe IHG Pet-Friendly Lineup IHG has 20 hotel brands, but not all of them welcome dogs. Here\u0026rsquo;s what you need to know:\nTier 1: The Gold Standard Kimpton Hotels ⭐ THE BEST\nWeight limit: None (\u0026ldquo;If your pet fits through the door, we\u0026rsquo;ll welcome them in\u0026rdquo;) Pet fee: $0 Breed restrictions: None Number of pets: Unlimited Pet types: Dogs, cats, birds, fish, even your pet lizard Kimpton isn\u0026rsquo;t just pet-friendly — they\u0026rsquo;re pet-obsessed. Every property has a \u0026ldquo;Director of Pet Relations\u0026rdquo; (usually an adorable resident dog). They\u0026rsquo;ll greet your pet by name, provide beds and bowls, and even give you a list of nearby dog parks and pet-friendly restaurants.\nThe nightly wine hour? Your dog is invited.\nTier 2: Always Pet-Friendly (With Fees) These brands welcome pets at ALL locations:\nStaybridge Suites\nWeight limit: 50 lbs (varies by property) Pet fee: ~$75/week Best for: Extended stays with a kitchen Candlewood Suites\nWeight limit: 80 lbs Pet fee: $75 for 1-6 nights, $150 for 7+ nights Best for: Budget-friendly extended stays Both are extended-stay brands with full kitchens — perfect for longer trips when you want to cook for yourself (and your pup).\nTier 3: Often Pet-Friendly (Check First) These brands have pet-friendly properties, but policies vary by location:\nHotel Indigo\nWeight limit: 40-80 lbs (varies) Pet fee: $50-$75 per stay Vibe: Boutique, artsy, neighborhood-focused InterContinental\nWeight limit: Varies widely Pet fee: Can be steep ($100-$250 in major cities) Best for: Luxury stays when you can find a good deal Crowne Plaza\nWeight limit: Varies by property Pet fee: Varies Note: Not all locations are pet-friendly Holiday Inn / Holiday Inn Express\nWeight limit: Usually 40-50 lbs Pet fee: $25-$75 per stay Note: Very hit-or-miss — always call ahead EVEN Hotels\nWeight limit: Varies Pet fee: Varies Vibe: Wellness-focused, often in suburban areas Tier 4: Usually NOT Pet-Friendly Six Senses Regent Vignette Collection HUALUXE Why Kimpton Wins for Large Dogs Let me be real: if you have a dog over 50 lbs, Kimpton is your only guaranteed option in the IHG family.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s why this matters:\nBrand 70-lb Dog Allowed? Kimpton ✅ Yes, always Candlewood Suites ✅ Yes (under 80 lbs) Staybridge Suites ❌ No (50 lb limit) Hotel Indigo ⚠️ Maybe (check property) Holiday Inn ❌ Usually no Ansel weighs 70 lbs. At Kimpton, nobody blinks. At most other IHG brands, we\u0026rsquo;d be turned away.\nHow to Earn IHG Points for Free Stays Here\u0026rsquo;s where it gets good. You can stay at Kimpton for free using IHG One Rewards points.\nThe IHG Credit Cards IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card ($99/year)\n140,000 bonus points after $3,000 spend Free night certificate every year (up to 40,000 points value) 4th night free on award stays Automatic Platinum Elite status IHG One Rewards Traveler Credit Card ($0/year)\n80,000 bonus points after $2,000 spend No annual fee Silver Elite status Point Values IHG points are worth about 0.5-0.6 cents each. A typical Kimpton redemption runs 30,000-60,000 points per night, though prices vary by date and location.\nPro tip: The 4th night free perk on the Premier card is huge. Book 4 nights and you essentially get 25% off your points redemption.\nTransfer Partners You can also transfer points to IHG from:\nChase Ultimate Rewards (1:1) Bilt Rewards (1:1) But honestly? IHG points aren\u0026rsquo;t the best use of Chase points. I\u0026rsquo;d rather transfer to Hyatt. The IHG credit card bonuses are usually the better path.\nKimpton vs. Hilton: Which Is Better for Dogs? I get this question a lot. Here\u0026rsquo;s my honest take:\nFactor Kimpton Hilton Pet fees $0 $0-$75 (varies) Weight limits None None (most brands) Number of properties ~70 7,000+ Loyalty program IHG One Rewards Hilton Honors Point value ~0.5¢ ~0.5¢ Best for Boutique experience, guaranteed pet-friendly More locations, easier to find availability My verdict: Kimpton is technically more dog-friendly, but Hilton\u0026rsquo;s massive footprint makes it more practical for everyday travel. I use both.\nIf there\u0026rsquo;s a Kimpton where I\u0026rsquo;m going? I book it. If not? Hilton it is.\nTips for Booking Pet-Friendly IHG Stays Always call the property directly — Even \u0026ldquo;dog-friendly\u0026rdquo; hotels can have restrictions that aren\u0026rsquo;t listed online.\nBook Kimpton for guaranteed acceptance — Don\u0026rsquo;t risk showing up with your 70-lb dog only to be told there\u0026rsquo;s a 50-lb limit.\nUse the IHG app filter — Search for \u0026ldquo;Pet Friendly\u0026rdquo; under amenities, but verify the specific policy.\nStack promotions — IHG frequently runs double/triple point promotions. Combine with credit card bonuses for maximum value.\nConsider extended-stay brands — Candlewood and Staybridge have kitchens, which is clutch for longer trips with dogs (no restaurant hunting!).\nThe Bottom Line If you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a large dog and want zero stress about pet policies, Kimpton is unbeatable. No weight limits, no fees, no judgment.\nThe trade-off? There are only about 70 Kimpton properties, mostly in major cities. You won\u0026rsquo;t find one in every small town.\nFor broader coverage, pair your IHG strategy with Hilton. Between the two programs, you\u0026rsquo;ll have pet-friendly options almost anywhere.\nMy recommendation:\nGet the IHG Premier card for Kimpton stays ($99/year, free night certificate pays for itself) Get the Hilton Surpass or Aspire for everywhere else Never pay pet fees again Have you stayed at a Kimpton with your dog? I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear about your experience — leave a pawprint and tell me which property!\nDisclosure: This post contains affiliate links.

Jump to:\nThe Policy What Makes Kimpton Different Pet Amenities Where to Find Kimptons How to Book Free FAQs Kimpton\u0026rsquo;s Pet Policy: The Details Policy Kimpton Pet fee $0 (free) Weight limit None Breed restrictions None Number of pets No limit Pet types Dogs, cats, birds, fish, and more That\u0026rsquo;s not a typo. Kimpton has no weight limit. They\u0026rsquo;ve welcomed Great Danes, Saint Bernards, and everything in between. Their unofficial motto is \u0026ldquo;if they fit through the door, they\u0026rsquo;re welcome.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat Makes Kimpton Different Kimpton didn\u0026rsquo;t just add \u0026ldquo;pet-friendly\u0026rdquo; to their website and call it a day. They built their entire brand around welcoming pets.\nNo Fees, Period Most \u0026ldquo;pet-friendly\u0026rdquo; hotels charge $50–$150 per stay. Kimpton charges nothing. Stay a week with your dog and you\u0026rsquo;re saving $100+ compared to other chains.\nNo Weight Limits This is the big one. Most hotels cap pets at 50–75 lbs. If you have a German Shepherd, Lab, Golden Retriever, or any other large breed, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably been turned away before.\nAt Kimpton, your 100-lb dog is just as welcome as a 10-lb dog. No awkward conversations at check-in. No hoping they don\u0026rsquo;t notice your dog is \u0026ldquo;a little over\u0026rdquo; the limit.\nNo Breed Restrictions Pit bulls, Rottweilers, Dobermans, German Shepherds — breeds that some hotels ban entirely are welcome at Kimpton. They judge dogs by behavior, not breed.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Not Just Tolerance — It\u0026rsquo;s Celebration Many Kimpton properties have a Director of Pet Relations — yes, that\u0026rsquo;s a dog with an official title. They host pet-friendly events, keep treats at the front desk, and genuinely love seeing dogs in the lobby.\nThe nightly wine hour? Your dog is invited.\nPet Amenities at Kimpton Kimpton doesn\u0026rsquo;t just allow pets — they roll out the red carpet:\nPet beds and bowls available on request (often in the room already) Treats at check-in at most properties Pet-friendly mini bar items at some locations Local pet recommendations — dog parks, pet stores, vet clinics Dog-walking services at select properties Pet-sitting referrals if you need a night out Some Kimptons even have dog-friendly restaurant patios on property where your pup can join you for dinner.\nKimpton Locations Kimpton operates 77+ hotels in the U.S. plus a few international locations. They\u0026rsquo;re a boutique brand, so you won\u0026rsquo;t find one in every small town — but they\u0026rsquo;re well-represented in major cities and popular destinations.\nCities with Multiple Kimptons: San Francisco (where Kimpton started) New York City Los Angeles Chicago Washington D.C. Seattle Denver Austin Miami / South Florida Portland Boston Notable Dog-Friendly Kimptons: Kimpton Hotel Monaco (Denver, Salt Lake City, Portland, others) Downtown locations with easy access to parks and trails. Known for particularly welcoming staff.\nKimpton Brice Hotel (Savannah) Enclosed courtyard perfect for the wine hour with your pup. Walking distance to Forsyth Park.\nKimpton Rowan (Palm Springs) Desert getaway with multiple dog parks nearby and pet-friendly restaurant patios everywhere.\nKimpton Arras (Asheville) Gateway to Blue Ridge Mountains hiking. Asheville is one of the most dog-friendly cities in the country.\nKimpton Journeyman (Milwaukee) Dedicated pet-friendly floors. Great urban location.\nHow to Book Kimpton Free with Points Kimpton is part of IHG One Rewards (InterContinental Hotels Group). You can book free stays using IHG points.\nEarning IHG Points Option 1: IHG Credit Cards\nCard Annual Fee Sign-Up Bonus Best For IHG One Rewards Traveler $0 80,000 points No-risk starting point IHG One Rewards Premier $99 140,000 points Regular Kimpton stays The Premier card also gives you:\n4th night free on award stays — book 4 nights, pay for 3 with points Free night certificate every year (up to 40,000 points value) Platinum Elite status — room upgrades when available Option 2: Transfer from Chase Ultimate Rewards\nChase points transfer 1:1 to IHG. If you have a Chase Sapphire Preferred or Reserve, you can move points to IHG when you find a Kimpton you want to book.\nHow Many Points for a Kimpton Stay? IHG uses dynamic pricing, so point costs vary. Typical Kimpton redemptions:\nDemand Points per Night Off-peak 25,000–40,000 Standard 40,000–60,000 Peak 70,000–100,000+ Pro tip: The 4th night free benefit on the IHG Premier card is huge for Kimpton stays. A 4-night trip that would cost 200,000 points becomes 150,000 — that\u0026rsquo;s 25% off.\nFor the full breakdown: How to Book Kimpton Hotels Free with Points\nKimpton vs. Other Pet-Friendly Hotels Factor Kimpton Hilton Marriott Pet fee $0 $50–$95 $75–$150 Weight limit None 50–75 lbs 25–75 lbs Breed restrictions None None (usually) Varies Number of properties 77+ 7,000+ 8,000+ Best for Large dogs, avoiding fees Most locations, points earning Widest footprint The trade-off: Kimpton has the best pet policy, but the smallest footprint. You won\u0026rsquo;t find a Kimpton in every city. For those destinations, Hilton or Marriott are solid backups.\nMy approach: Book Kimpton whenever there\u0026rsquo;s one where I\u0026rsquo;m going. Use Hilton for everywhere else.\nFrequently Asked Questions Is Kimpton really free for pets? Yes. No pet fee, no deposit, no hidden charges. This has been their policy since 1992 and they\u0026rsquo;ve never wavered.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the actual weight limit? There isn\u0026rsquo;t one. They\u0026rsquo;ve hosted Great Danes, Mastiffs, and Irish Wolfhounds. If your dog can walk through the door, they\u0026rsquo;re welcome.\nCan I bring multiple pets? Yes. Kimpton doesn\u0026rsquo;t limit the number of pets. Traveling with 3 dogs? Still welcome, still free.\nWhat about cats, birds, or other pets? Kimpton welcomes all pets — dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, fish, even monkeys (yes, really). They\u0026rsquo;re not dog-specific like some \u0026ldquo;pet-friendly\u0026rdquo; hotels.\nDo I need to notify them in advance? It\u0026rsquo;s courteous to mention you\u0026rsquo;re bringing a pet when booking, but it\u0026rsquo;s not required. You won\u0026rsquo;t be turned away for showing up with a dog.\nCan my dog be alone in the room? Kimpton allows pets to be left in the room as long as they\u0026rsquo;re comfortable and won\u0026rsquo;t disturb other guests. If your dog barks when alone, consider crating them or taking them with you.\nAre there pet-friendly rooms vs. regular rooms? No distinction. Every room at Kimpton is pet-friendly. You won\u0026rsquo;t be relegated to a ground-floor smoking room from 1987.\nWhat if my dog damages something? You\u0026rsquo;re responsible for any damage, same as any hotel. But Kimpton doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a pet deposit, which shows how confident they are in pet owners.\nThe Bottom Line If you have a large dog, a \u0026ldquo;scary\u0026rdquo; breed, or you\u0026rsquo;re just tired of paying pet fees, Kimpton is the answer. No other major hotel chain comes close to their pet policy.\nThe only downside is their limited footprint — 77 hotels doesn\u0026rsquo;t compete with Hilton\u0026rsquo;s 7,000. But when there\u0026rsquo;s a Kimpton where you\u0026rsquo;re going, book it. Your dog will thank you.\nRead next: How to Book Kimpton Free with Points | Traveling with a Large Dog: Hotel Policies You Need to Know | Best Credit Cards for Pet Travelers\n","date":"2025-12-10T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/kimpton-pet-policy-2025/","title":"Kimpton Pet Policy 2025: No Fees, No Weight Limits, No Restrictions"},{"content":"Living in Jacksonville means you\u0026rsquo;re surrounded by beach towns worth exploring with your dog. Some are close enough for a lazy lunch. Others are worth a full weekend. Here are the spots Ansel and I keep coming back to.\n(Hitting the road? Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to check out my road trip essentials for traveling with your dog.)\nJacksonville Beach Drive time: 25 minutes\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to go far. Jax Beach has a ton of dog-friendly restaurants — over 40 according to BringFido — so finding a patio that welcomes your pup is never a problem.\nOne favorite is Salt Life Food Shack, just three blocks from the beach. Dogs are welcome on the downstairs patio, and they\u0026rsquo;ll bring out a water bowl without you asking. Great surf-and-turf menu with tacos, sushi rolls, and fresh seafood. It\u0026rsquo;s casual, breezy, and Ansel always gets compliments from other diners.\nPro tip: Go for a late lunch to beat the crowds. The patio fills up fast on weekends.\nAmelia Island Drive time: 45 minutes\nThis is one of the most dog-friendly spots in the area. The beaches allow leashed dogs, downtown Fernandina Beach has plenty of dog-friendly patios, and the whole island has a relaxed, walkable vibe. Great for a day trip or a quick overnight.\nOne spot I always recommend is The Patio at 5th and Ash — a casual American bistro with a beautiful outdoor patio under oak trees draped in Spanish moss. They\u0026rsquo;re genuinely dog-friendly and even have a dog menu with homemade biscuits. Ansel was very focused on earning one.\nPro tip: If you\u0026rsquo;re staying overnight, check out the Hilton properties on the island. Some are dog-friendly and bookable on points. (See my credit cards guide for how I earn free nights.)\nPalm Coast / Flagler Beach Drive time: 1 hour 15 minutes\nFlagler Beach is low-key and locals love it. Dogs are allowed on the beach (leashed), and the pier area has a few casual spots to grab food. It\u0026rsquo;s less crowded than Daytona and has more of a small-town feel.\nThis is a good \u0026ldquo;decompress\u0026rdquo; destination — not a ton of activities, just beach, food, and chill. Sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what you need.\nNew Smyrna Beach Drive time: 2 hours\nNSB has a great mix of beach access and dog-friendly dining. The vibe is artsy and laid-back — lots of murals, local shops, and good food.\nOne spot I always stop at is Yellow Dog Eats — a funky sandwich shop with a big outdoor patio where dogs are welcome. The food is creative (think smoked meats, interesting sandwiches), and the whole place just feels like it was made for people who travel with their dogs.\nAnsel cooling off on the patio. That sign in the background says it all.\nHe\u0026rsquo;s very polite about sharing. Usually.\nDaytona Beach Drive time: 1 hour 45 minutes\nDaytona is hit or miss for dogs — the main beach doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow them during peak hours, but there are designated dog-friendly areas. The boardwalk area has some dog-friendly patios, and it\u0026rsquo;s a good base if you want to explore the surrounding towns.\nHonestly, I usually skip Daytona proper and head to NSB or Flagler instead. But if you\u0026rsquo;re in the area, it\u0026rsquo;s worth a stop.\nQuick Reference Destination Drive Time Beach Access Best For Jacksonville Beach 25 min Limited dog hours Quick lunch, tons of patios Amelia Island 45 min Leashed dogs allowed Day trip or weekend, walkable downtown Flagler Beach 1 hr 15 min Leashed dogs allowed Quiet beach day, low-key vibes New Smyrna Beach 2 hrs Dog-friendly areas Artsy town, great food, worth a weekend Daytona Beach 1 hr 45 min Designated areas only Skip unless passing through The Bottom Line All of these are easy drives from Jacksonville and make great trips with your dog. Pack a travel bag, book a dog-friendly hotel (on points, of course), and go explore.\nWant more posts about the places we eat and stay?

Why Kimpton for Dog Travelers Kimpton became the first major hotel chain to go pet-friendly back in 1992. They weren\u0026rsquo;t just tolerating pets — they built it into the brand. Here\u0026rsquo;s what you actually get:\nNo pet fee — not even for extended stays No weight or breed restrictions — Great Danes, pit bulls, whatever Pet amenities included — loaner beds, bowls, treats at check-in Pet-friendly wine hour — the nightly hosted reception welcomes dogs Director of Pet Relations at some properties — yes, it\u0026rsquo;s a dog With 77+ locations in the US and a few international properties, you\u0026rsquo;ve got solid coverage in most major cities.\nThe catch? Kimpton is a boutique brand, so rates tend to run higher than your typical Hilton or Marriott. That\u0026rsquo;s where points come in.\nHow to Earn IHG Points for Kimpton Kimpton is part of IHG (InterContinental Hotels Group), so you book using IHG One Rewards points. There are two main ways to stack up enough points for free stays:\nIHG credit cards (direct earning) Chase Ultimate Rewards (transfer partner) Option 1: IHG Credit Cards If you stay at IHG properties regularly, their co-branded Chase cards make sense.\n💎 IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card The card for frequent IHG travelers.\nAnnual Fee $99 Sign-Up Bonus 140,000 points after $3,000 spend in 3 months Free Night 1/year at properties up to 40,000 points Status Platinum Elite That 140,000-point bonus is enough for 2-4 free nights at most Kimptons, depending on the property and dates.\nKey perks:\n💳 26x points at IHG properties ✈️ 5x on travel, gas, and restaurants 🌙 4th night free on award stays (book 4, pay for 3) 🎁 Annual free night certificate 💡 Pro tip: The 4th night free benefit is huge. If you\u0026rsquo;re booking a 4-night Kimpton stay with points, you\u0026rsquo;re effectively getting 25% off. A 200,000-point redemption becomes 150,000.\nHow the $99 fee pays for itself:\nPerk Value Annual free night certificate $200+ 4th night free on award stays Varies Total $200+ 🆓 IHG One Rewards Traveler Credit Card The no-risk starting point.\nAnnual Fee $0 Sign-Up Bonus 80,000 points after $2,000 spend in 3 months Free Night None Status None If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure how often you\u0026rsquo;ll stay at IHG properties, this is a safe way to start earning points. 80,000 points for $2,000 in spending with no annual fee is solid.\nKey perks:\n💳 17x points at IHG properties 🍽️ 3x on dining, gas, and groceries 🌙 4th night free on award stays (yes, even with the no-fee card) Option 2: Chase Ultimate Rewards Transfer If you want more flexibility, Chase Ultimate Rewards points transfer 1:1 to IHG. This is my preferred approach because I can use the same points for flights, other hotels, or cash back if I need to.\nCards that earn transferable Ultimate Rewards:\nChase Sapphire Preferred Annual Fee $95 Sign-Up Bonus 60,000 points after $4,000 spend in 3 months 3x on dining, select streaming, and online groceries 2x on travel Points transfer to 14+ airline and hotel partners including IHG Chase Sapphire Reserve Annual Fee $550 Sign-Up Bonus 60,000 points after $4,000 spend in 3 months 3x on dining and travel $300 annual travel credit (effectively reduces fee to $250) Priority Pass lounge access Points worth 1.5x when booked through Chase Travel 💡 Pro tip: If you already have a Sapphire card for travel, you don\u0026rsquo;t need an IHG card. Just transfer points when you find a Kimpton you want to book. Transfers are instant.\nHow Many Points Do Kimpton Stays Cost? IHG uses dynamic pricing, so point costs vary by property, date, and demand. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen:\nDemand Points/Night Example Off-peak 20,000–35,000 Midweek in shoulder season Standard 40,000–60,000 Most weekends Peak 70,000–100,000+ Holidays, special events For reference, I searched Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver for a random February weekend and found award nights around 45,000 points. Paid rates were $280/night, so that\u0026rsquo;s solid value.\nRemember: If you have the IHG Premier card, book 4 nights and the 4th is free. That 180,000-point booking becomes 135,000.\nBest Kimpton Properties for Dog Travelers Not every Kimpton is equal when it comes to dog-friendliness (location matters). Here are some I\u0026rsquo;ve researched or have on my list:\n🏔️ Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver Downtown location with easy access to trails. The wine hour is popular, and staff are known for going above and beyond for pets. Close to Cherry Creek Dog Park.\n🌳 Kimpton Brice Hotel (Savannah) Enclosed courtyard that\u0026rsquo;s perfect for the evening wine reception with your pup. Walking distance to Forsyth Park — one of the most dog-friendly parks in the South.\n🌴 Kimpton Rowan Palm Springs Near several dog parks and surrounded by pet-friendly restaurant patios. Great for a desert getaway when it\u0026rsquo;s not 115°F.\n🏔️ Kimpton Arras (Asheville) Gateway to Blue Ridge Mountains hiking. Asheville is extremely dog-friendly, with tons of outdoor dining and brewery patios that welcome dogs.\n🍺 Kimpton Journeyman (Milwaukee) Dedicated pet-friendly floors. Good urban location for exploring with your dog.\nWhich Card Should You Get? You\u0026hellip; Get This Why 🆕 New to points IHG Traveler 80k bonus, no fee, no risk 🏨 Stay at IHG often IHG Premier 140k bonus, free night, 4th night free ✈️ Want flexibility Chase Sapphire Preferred Transfer to IHG + 13 other partners 💎 Already have Hilton cards Chase Sapphire Preferred Add IHG as a transfer option If you\u0026rsquo;re already in the Hilton ecosystem (like me), the Sapphire Preferred is a good complement. You keep your Hilton setup for most trips and transfer Chase points to IHG when you want to book a Kimpton.\nThe Bottom Line Kimpton is the best hotel chain for dog travelers, full stop. No other major brand matches their policy — no fees, no weight limits, no breed restrictions, and actual dog amenities beyond a sad bowl at the front desk.\nThe only downside is price. Kimpton properties aren\u0026rsquo;t cheap. But that\u0026rsquo;s exactly why points matter here. A $300/night boutique hotel stay feels very different when it costs you 45,000 points you earned from everyday spending.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a large dog and want a stress-free check-in experience, Kimpton should be on your radar. And now you know how to book it free.\nHave you stayed at a Kimpton with your dog? I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear which property — reach out and let me know.\nRead next: Best Credit Cards for Dog Travelers | Traveling with a Large Dog: Hotel Policies You Need to Know\n","date":"2025-12-08T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/kimpton-points-guide/","title":"How to Book Kimpton Hotels Free with Points"},{"content":"The drive from Jacksonville to Panama City Beach is about 5-7 hours depending on how many stops you make — and if you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a dog, you\u0026rsquo;re going to make a lot of stops. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I learned driving this route with Ansel, my 70-pound GSP/Lab mix.\n(Planning a PCB trip? Check out my full Embassy Suites Panama City Beach review for the hotel details.)\nThe Route From Jacksonville (I started in Callahan), you\u0026rsquo;ll take I-10 West through Lake City, Tallahassee, and then head south on US-231 into Panama City Beach. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly highway driving with plenty of rest areas along the way.\nDistance: ~350 miles\nDrive time: 5-7 hours (with dog stops)\nBest Stops Along the Way The Must-Stop: Busy Bee If you only make one non-potty stop, make it Busy Bee. It\u0026rsquo;s basically Florida\u0026rsquo;s answer to Buc-ee\u0026rsquo;s — spotless restrooms (seriously, some of the cleanest gas station bathrooms you\u0026rsquo;ll ever see), a huge selection of snacks, jerky, fudge, and their famous Bee Bites. There\u0026rsquo;s also a Burger King and Dunkin\u0026rsquo; inside if you need real food.\nThere are two locations on I-10:\nLive Oak (Exit 283) — about 1.5 hours from Jacksonville Lake City (US-41 near I-75) — slightly earlier if you\u0026rsquo;re coming from the Callahan area Both have plenty of room to walk your dog around before heading back on the road. It\u0026rsquo;s worth the stop.\nRest Areas Florida\u0026rsquo;s I-10 rest areas are well-maintained with grassy pet areas:\nSuwannee County Rest Area (Mile Marker 294) — Good first stop Madison County Rest Area (Mile Marker 265) — Midway point Leon County Rest Area (Mile Marker 194) — Just west of Tallahassee All have pet areas, restrooms, and vending machines. Nothing fancy, but they get the job done.\nComing Soon: Buc-ee\u0026rsquo;s Buc-ee\u0026rsquo;s is building a massive 75,000 square foot location near Tallahassee on I-10. Once that opens, it\u0026rsquo;ll be another great option. For now, Busy Bee has you covered.\nWhat I Packed (And What I\u0026rsquo;d Do Differently) What Worked Backseat cover — Non-negotiable. Keeps the car clean and gives your dog a non-slip surface. Travel water bottle with attached bowl — Perfect for rest stops without digging through bags. Extra poop bags — I always overpack. Running out at a rest area is not ideal. His favorite blanket — Familiar smells help anxious dogs settle. (For my full packing list, check out road trip essentials for traveling with your dog.)\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;d Do Differently: The Crate Situation I made the mistake of bringing Ansel\u0026rsquo;s wire crate to use in the hotel room. The problem? It rattled the entire drive. Every bump, every turn — rattle, rattle, rattle. Ansel is an anxious boy when it comes to weird sounds, so by the time we arrived, he was stressed and I was frustrated.\nThe fix: Get a crash-tested travel kennel that stays in the car.\nThe two best options:\nGunner Kennel — The gold standard. 5-star crash test rating from the Center for Pet Safety, double-wall construction for temperature regulation, and built like a tank. For a 70-lb dog, you\u0026rsquo;d want the Large. They\u0026rsquo;re pricey (~$500+) and heavy (~72 lbs), but if safety is your priority, this is it.\nRuffland Kennel — The more budget-friendly option (~$300-350). Single-piece roto-molded plastic, lighter weight, and performed well in crash testing when secured against the seatback. A lot of hunters and dog sport people swear by these.\nEither way, your dog rides safer and you skip the rattling nightmare. I\u0026rsquo;m upgrading before my next trip.\nTiming Tips Leave early. If you leave Jacksonville by 7am, you can be in PCB by early afternoon with plenty of stops. Plan for stops every 2 hours — or whenever your dog tells you it\u0026rsquo;s time. Avoid Tallahassee rush hour if possible (typically 4-6pm). The last hour (US-231 south into PCB) is the slowest part — two-lane roads and beach traffic. The Bottom Line This is an easy drive if you plan for it. Pack smart, stop at Busy Bee, and invest in a proper travel crate. Your dog (and your sanity) will thank you.\nReady to book the hotel?

If you have a larger dog, your card strategy should account for that:\nUnder 50 lbs: You\u0026rsquo;re welcome almost everywhere. Hilton and Marriott cards work great. 50-75 lbs: Still good options, but check policies before booking. 75+ lbs: Kimpton (IHG) is your best friend — no weight limits, no breed restrictions, no pet fees. If weight limits are a constant headache, IHG cards or Chase Sapphire (which transfers to IHG) should be on your radar.\nThe Quick Version Card Annual Fee Best For Hilton Aspire $550 Frequent travelers who want Diamond status Hilton Surpass $150 Regular travelers who want Gold + free night Hilton (no fee) $0 Beginners, no risk IHG Premier $99 Large dogs, Kimpton stays IHG Traveler $0 Large dogs, no fee commitment Chase Sapphire Preferred $95 Flexibility across multiple chains Marriott Boundless $95 Best sign-up bonus (3 free nights) Related Reads Best Credit Cards for Dog Travelers (2025) — Full breakdown of every card How to Book Kimpton Hotels Free with Points — The best chain for large dogs Traveling with a Large Dog: Hotel Policies You Need to Know — Weight limits by chain Quiz: Which Hilton Credit Card Is Best for Dog Travelers? — Hilton-specific quiz if you\u0026rsquo;re already loyal Disclosure: This post contains affiliate links.

But once your pup crosses that 50-pound threshold? Suddenly half your options disappear.\nI travel with Ansel, my 70-pound German Shorthaired Pointer/Lab mix. He\u0026rsquo;s a lanky, well-behaved sweetheart—but on paper, he\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;too big\u0026rdquo; for a lot of hotels. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the same boat with your large dog, here\u0026rsquo;s everything I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about navigating hotel weight limits.\nThe Weight Limit Problem Most hotel chains set their pet weight limits between 50-75 pounds. The logic seems to be liability and room size, but the limits often feel arbitrary. A calm 80-pound Lab is going to cause fewer issues than a hyper 30-pound terrier, but policies don\u0026rsquo;t account for temperament.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;ll typically see:\nUnder 50 lbs: Welcome almost everywhere 50-75 lbs: Many options, but you\u0026rsquo;ll need to check policies 75+ lbs: Options get limited fast The good news? Several hotel chains have no weight limits at all, and others are more flexible than their official policies suggest.\nHotels with NO Weight Limits These chains welcome dogs of any size—no awkward conversations at check-in required.\nKimpton Hotels The gold standard for large dog travel. Their unofficial motto is \u0026ldquo;if they fit through the door, they\u0026rsquo;re welcome.\u0026rdquo; They\u0026rsquo;ve hosted everything from Great Danes to llamas. No pet fee, no weight limit, and many properties have a resident \u0026ldquo;Director of Pet Relations\u0026rdquo; (a very good dog). The nightly wine reception often welcomes pups too.\nBest for: Travelers who want a boutique experience and don\u0026rsquo;t mind paying more per night.\nMotel 6 / Studio 6 The most budget-friendly option for large dogs. No pet fee at Motel 6, and no weight or breed restrictions. Studio 6 (their extended stay brand) charges around $10/night but still has no size limit.\nBest for: Road trippers who need affordable, no-questions-asked pet lodging.\nLa Quinta La Quinta used to be the holy grail—no pet fee and no weight limit. Since Wyndham acquired them, policies vary more by location. Many still have no restrictions, but some now cap at 75 pounds with a $25/night fee. Always call ahead to confirm.\nBest for: Frequent travelers who want consistency and don\u0026rsquo;t mind calling to verify.\nRed Roof Inn No weight limit, no breed restrictions, and no pet fee. They also provide designated dog walk areas with waste bags at each location. A solid budget option that genuinely welcomes large dogs.\nBest for: Budget road trips where you want a pet-friendly guarantee.\nLoews Hotels All 24 Loews properties accept dogs of any size. The \u0026ldquo;Loews Loves Pets\u0026rdquo; program provides beds, bowls, treats, and even a room service menu for dogs. Fees vary by property but are typically reasonable for the upscale experience.\nBest for: Special occasions when you want to treat yourself and your pup.\nSonesta (All Brands) Royal Sonesta, Sonesta Hotels, Sonesta Select, Sonesta ES Suites, and Sonesta Simply Suites all allow pets with no breed or size limit. Standard fee is $75 per stay (or $150 for stays over 7 nights).\nBest for: Extended stays and business travel with your dog.\nHotels with 75-80 lb Limits If your dog is in the 50-80 pound range, these chains will likely work:\nChain Weight Limit Pet Fee Notes Best Western 80 lbs per dog ~$30/night Policies vary by location Drury Hotels 80 lbs combined $50/night Up to 2 pets Candlewood Suites 80 lbs $75-150/stay IHG property My Place Hotels 80 lbs $15-30/night Midwest-focused chain Extended Stay America 36\u0026quot; x 36\u0026quot; Varies Measures by size, not weight! Pro tip: Extended Stay America measures dogs by dimensions rather than weight. If your dog is under 36 inches tall and 36 inches long, you\u0026rsquo;re good—that covers most large breeds except giant breeds.\nWhat About Hilton? Since I focus a lot on Hilton for points travel, here\u0026rsquo;s the reality: most Hilton brands cap at 50-75 pounds, and it varies by property.\nHilton brands that tend to be more flexible:\nHome2 Suites (75 lb limit) Hilton Garden Inn (75 lb limit at most locations) Homewood Suites (75 lb limit) DoubleTree (varies widely—some have no limit) Canopy by Hilton (very pet-friendly, 50-75 lbs) Always call the specific property before booking. The website might say 50 pounds, but the front desk often has discretion—especially for well-behaved dogs.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re earning Hilton points for dog travel, check out my Hilton credit card quiz to find the right card for your travel style.\nTips for When Your Dog Exceeds the Limit Here\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from traveling with a dog who\u0026rsquo;s technically \u0026ldquo;too big\u0026rdquo; for some policies:\n1. Call the hotel directly Don\u0026rsquo;t just book online and hope for the best. Call the front desk, explain your dog\u0026rsquo;s size and temperament, and ask if they can accommodate you. Many hotels will say yes even if the official policy says no—they care more about behavior than the number on the scale.\n2. Be honest Don\u0026rsquo;t lie about your dog\u0026rsquo;s weight. If you show up with an obviously-larger-than-stated dog, you risk being turned away. Honesty builds trust and often gets you further than trying to sneak by.\n3. Mention good behavior \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s 70 pounds but very calm and well-trained\u0026rdquo; goes a long way. Hotels worry about noise complaints and damage—if you can reassure them your dog won\u0026rsquo;t cause issues, they\u0026rsquo;re more likely to flex on the weight limit.\n4. Offer a larger deposit If a hotel is hesitant, offering to put down a larger refundable deposit can ease their concerns. It shows you\u0026rsquo;re confident in your dog\u0026rsquo;s behavior.\n5. Book pet-friendly room types Some hotels have designated pet rooms that can accommodate larger dogs. Ask specifically about these when you call.\n6. Use BringFido BringFido is the best resource for finding genuinely pet-friendly hotels. They verify policies and can even help negotiate weight limit exceptions through their Canine Concierge service.\n7. Use the Hotel Pet Policy Finder Not sure about a specific chain\u0026rsquo;s policy? Use my Hotel Pet Policy Finder to quickly check weight limits and fees for any major hotel brand.\nThe Reality Check Hotels rarely actually weigh dogs. Most front desk staff will eyeball your pup and decide if they\u0026rsquo;re comfortable. A well-groomed, calm dog on a leash makes a much better impression than a dog that\u0026rsquo;s pulling and barking—regardless of size.\nThat said, don\u0026rsquo;t abuse this. If a hotel says 50 pounds and you show up with a 120-pound Mastiff, you\u0026rsquo;re putting the staff in an awkward position and potentially ruining it for other large-dog travelers.\nMy Go-To Strategy For road trips with Ansel, here\u0026rsquo;s my approach:\nFirst choice: La Quinta or Red Roof Inn (no restrictions, budget-friendly) If I want something nicer: Kimpton or Loews (splurge-worthy, genuinely welcoming) If using Hilton points: Home2 Suites or Homewood Suites (call ahead to confirm) Always: Call the specific property before booking to confirm they\u0026rsquo;ll welcome my 70-pound guy The Bottom Line Traveling with a large dog takes more planning, but it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely doable. The key is knowing which chains are genuinely welcoming versus which ones just tolerate pets. Stick with the no-weight-limit chains for stress-free bookings, and always call ahead when you\u0026rsquo;re unsure.\nYour big dog deserves adventures too. Don\u0026rsquo;t let arbitrary weight limits keep you home.\nHave a favorite hotel chain for large dogs?

Some properties say they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;pet-friendly\u0026rdquo; but hit you with breed restrictions, weight limits, or fees that make you feel like your dog isn\u0026rsquo;t actually welcome.\nHilton is different. Here\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s become my go-to for dog travel.\nEvery Hilton Brand Welcomes Dogs This is the big one. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re staying at a Hampton Inn on a road trip or splurging on a Waldorf Astoria for a special occasion, every Hilton brand in the U.S. accepts pets.\nThat consistency matters when you\u0026rsquo;re planning trips with a dog. No more calling ahead to individual properties hoping they\u0026rsquo;ll say yes. No more getting turned away at check-in because someone didn\u0026rsquo;t update the website.\nThe brands include:\nHampton Inn \u0026amp; Suites Hilton Garden Inn Home2 Suites Homewood Suites DoubleTree Embassy Suites Hilton Hotels \u0026amp; Resorts Canopy by Hilton Curio Collection Tapestry Collection Conrad Hotels Waldorf Astoria One caveat: Weight limits vary by property, typically ranging from 50-75 lbs. If you have a larger dog, always call ahead to confirm. Check out my guide to traveling with large dogs for more tips.\nPoints Are Easy to Earn Hilton points are some of the easiest hotel points to stack through everyday spending. With the right credit card, you can earn points on:\nGroceries (including all that dog food) Gas stations (road trip fuel-ups) Restaurants (dog-friendly patios count!) Vet bills and pet supplies Everything else I\u0026rsquo;ve booked multiple free nights at pet-friendly Hiltons without setting foot in a hotel — just from everyday spending on my Hilton credit card.\nNot sure which card is right for you? Take my quick quiz to find your perfect match.\nDiamond Status Makes Dog Travel Easier Hilton\u0026rsquo;s top-tier status, Diamond, comes with perks that are especially valuable when you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a dog:\nRoom upgrades — More space means more room for your pup to spread out. I\u0026rsquo;ve been upgraded to suites multiple times, and the extra square footage makes a huge difference with a 70-pound dog.\nLate checkout — Morning potty breaks, packing up dog gear, loading the car\u0026hellip; it all takes longer with a pet. Late checkout (often until 2pm) gives you breathing room.\nDaily food \u0026amp; beverage credit — Pet fees add up. Having your meals partially covered helps offset those costs.\nExecutive lounge access — A quiet spot to grab coffee or a snack, away from the chaos of the main lobby.\nThe best part? You don\u0026rsquo;t have to stay 60 nights a year to get Diamond. The Hilton Aspire card gives you automatic Diamond status just for having the card.\nPet Fees Are Reasonable Hilton pet fees typically range from $50-$95 per stay, depending on the brand and location. That\u0026rsquo;s middle-of-the-road for the industry — not the cheapest, but far from the worst offenders.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re booking on points, the pet fee is often your only out-of-pocket cost. I\u0026rsquo;ll happily pay $75 for a \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; hotel stay at a property I know will welcome my dog without hassle.\nMy Hilton Dog Travel Stack Here\u0026rsquo;s the setup I use for earning and booking dog-friendly Hilton stays:\nHilton Aspire Card — Automatic Diamond status, annual free night certificate, $400 resort credit Hilton Points — Earned from everyday spending, used for free nights 5th Night Free — Book 4 nights on points, get the 5th free (20% savings!) BringFido — For double-checking pet policies and weight limits at specific properties This combo has gotten me free stays at dog-friendly Embassy Suites, Hilton Garden Inns, and more — with Ansel welcome at every single one.\nReady to Start? If you\u0026rsquo;re new to Hilton points and want to start traveling free with your pup, here\u0026rsquo;s where to begin:\nTake the quiz to find the right Hilton credit card for your travel style Learn about Diamond status and why it\u0026rsquo;s worth pursuing Compare all the credit card options if you want the full breakdown Have questions?

I\u0026rsquo;d been eyeing the Embassy Suites by Hilton Panama City Beach Resort for a while — it\u0026rsquo;s dog-friendly, right across from the beach, and I had a stack of Hilton points burning a hole in my account. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it went.\nSomeone approved of the room upgrade.\nThe Booking I used my Hilton Honors American Express Surpass points plus a free night certificate to book this stay. I stayed for 5 nights — and here\u0026rsquo;s a tip: when you book 4 nights with points, the 5th night is free. That\u0026rsquo;s a 20% discount built right in.\nThe only thing I actually paid out of pocket? Tipping the valet. That\u0026rsquo;s it.\nPet fees: $75 for stays of 1-4 nights, or $125 for 5+ nights. They allow up to 2 pets, max 75 lbs each, dogs and cats only. No breed restrictions. Ansel is a 70-pound German Shorthaired Pointer/Lab mix, so he squeaked in under the limit.\nPro tip: If you have Hilton Diamond status, request a room upgrade when you book. I asked and got bumped to a king suite with an ocean view and a balcony. Ansel spent a solid 20 minutes every morning just watching the beach from up there.\n(New to points and hotel status? Check out my guide to the best credit cards for dog travelers and how Hilton Diamond status works.)\nThe Hotel: What You Need to Know The Embassy Suites PCB is located right by Pier Park, across the street from the beach. Not beachfront, but close enough that it\u0026rsquo;s a 5-minute walk to sand. In fact, everything we did — Dog Beach, Pier Park, Margaritaville — was within walking distance of the hotel. We barely moved the car all week.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing nobody tells you: there\u0026rsquo;s only one elevator.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a dog — especially a bigger one who needs to go out first thing in the morning — request a room close to the elevator. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think to ask, and our first morning involved a very long hallway walk with an increasingly urgent pup. Lesson learned.\nMaking himself at home.\nThe room itself was spacious (it\u0026rsquo;s a suite, so you get a separate living area), clean, and the balcony was a huge win. Ansel could hang out there while I got ready without feeling cooped up.\nThe hotel also has designated dog areas around the property with poop bag stations, so those early morning and late night potty breaks are easy.\nNote: Dogs are not allowed at the pool. If you want pool time, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to plan around it (more on that below).\nThe Beach The big draw here is Dog Beach — an exclusive dog beach right across from Pier Park. You can see the \u0026ldquo;Welcome to Dog Beach\u0026rdquo; sign from Margaritaville. It\u0026rsquo;s a short walk from the hotel.\nThe destination.\nFirst time touching PCB sand.\nThat Gulf water is unreal.\nDog-Friendly Dining One of the best parts of PCB is how many restaurants have dog-friendly patios — and most of them are walking distance from the hotel. We hit up Margaritaville — great views, Ansel got tons of attention, and they didn\u0026rsquo;t bat an eye at a 70-pound dog under the table.\nLunch with a view.\nHe was very well-behaved (mostly).\nExploring Pier Park Pier Park is a huge outdoor shopping area right next to the hotel — literally a few minutes walk. Lots of stores, restaurants, and photo ops. Ansel found his way onto a Ron Jon surfboard.\nSurfer pup.\nRoad Trip Essentials: What I Packed A few things that made the drive with a 70-pound dog way easier:\nBackseat cover — Protects the seats, gives Ansel a non-slip surface, and makes cleanup a breeze. Travel water bottle with bowl — Attaches right to a cup holder. Perfect for rest stops. Poop bags — I always overpack. Running out at a hotel is not the move. (For my full packing list, check out road trip essentials for traveling with your dog.)\nNeed a Break? Daycare \u0026amp; Grooming Options Sometimes you want to hit the pool or grab dinner somewhere that isn\u0026rsquo;t dog-friendly. Here are your options near the hotel:\nZOOMIES Pet Hotel — Full daycare, boarding, and grooming. Book ahead, especially on weekends. Dagny and Dexter\u0026rsquo;s — Another solid daycare option nearby. PetSmart in Pier Park — Right next door for grooming or supplies. I dropped Ansel off here for a grooming session so I could spend a few hours at the pool. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend booking daycare in advance if you know you\u0026rsquo;ll want pool time or want to explore without the dog for a day.\nThe Verdict This was a genuinely easy trip. The hotel is well-located for a dog-friendly beach weekend, the points redemption felt like good value, and Ansel had a blast.\nWould I go back? Yeah, probably. Next time I\u0026rsquo;ll be smarter about requesting a room near the elevator, and I\u0026rsquo;ll book daycare in advance so I can get more pool time.\nAnsel\u0026rsquo;s Rating: 4/5 Paws 🐾🐾🐾🐾 What he loved: The balcony. The beach. All the new smells at Pier Park.\nWhat he didn\u0026rsquo;t love: That long hallway walk at 6am.\nQuick Reference Detail Info Hotel Embassy Suites by Hilton Panama City Beach Resort Location Across from beach, next to Pier Park Pet Policy 2 pets max, 75 lbs each, dogs/cats only, no breed restrictions Pet Fee $75 (1-4 nights) or $125 (5+ nights) Points Used Hilton Honors (via Surpass card + free night cert) Out of Pocket Valet tip only Dog-Friendly Beach Dog Beach, walking distance Dog Areas On-site with poop bag stations Pool No dogs allowed — use grooming/daycare for pool time Grooming PetSmart in Pier Park Daycare ZOOMIES Pet Hotel, Dagny and Dexter\u0026rsquo;s (book ahead!)

Here\u0026rsquo;s my go-to list for traveling with a 70-pound dog.\n🚗 Car Setup Seat cover — Non-negotiable. I use one in my 4Runner that covers the entire back seat, has flaps that protect the doors, and is waterproof. Saves your interior from muddy paws, sand, and the occasional drool puddle.\nCrash-tested crate — If your dog does better contained, a crate is the safest option. Brands like Gunner and Ruff Land are pricey but built to protect your dog in an accident. Worth it for peace of mind on long drives.\nCar barrier — If a crate doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit your setup, a barrier keeps them in the back without roaming into the front seat. Less secure than a crate, but better than nothing.\nSeat belt harness — Another safety option if you don\u0026rsquo;t use a crate. Clips into your seatbelt and keeps your dog secured. Look for crash-tested options.\n💧 Food \u0026amp; Water Travel water bottle with bowl attachment — This is the one thing I\u0026rsquo;d never skip. Mine has a bowl that screws onto the top, so I can give Ansel water at rest stops without digging through bags. Fits right in the cup holder.\nCollapsible bowls — Cheap, packable, and useful for food or water at the hotel. I keep a couple in my bag at all times.\nFood storage — I portion out food into ziplock bags or use a small airtight container. Keeps things simple and avoids lugging an entire bag of kibble.\n🛏️ Comfort Items Pet blanket — Ansel has a designated travel blanket. It smells like home, which helps him settle in unfamiliar hotel rooms. Also useful for covering hotel furniture if you\u0026rsquo;re worried about fur.\nFavorite toy — Something familiar to keep them occupied during downtime. Don\u0026rsquo;t bring anything too squeaky unless you want to hear it for 5 hours straight.\nTreats — For rewarding good behavior, training moments, and bribing them back into the car after a rest stop. I pack more than I think I\u0026rsquo;ll need.\n🧹 Safety \u0026amp; Cleanup Poop bags — I always overpack. Running out at a hotel or rest stop is not a situation you want to be in. Bring twice as many as you think you need.\nPet first aid kit — Basic stuff: bandages, antiseptic wipes, tweezers for ticks, Benadryl (ask your vet for dosage). You probably won\u0026rsquo;t need it, but you\u0026rsquo;ll be glad you have it.\nTowels — At least one or two. For wet paws, muddy adventures, post-beach shakeoffs, or unexpected messes. Old towels work great.\nLint roller — Your future self will thank you. Keep one in the car and one in your bag.\n📋 Documents Vaccination records — Some hotels ask for proof of rabies vaccination. Keep a copy on your phone or in the car. I take a photo of Ansel\u0026rsquo;s records so I always have them.\nID tags — Make sure your dog\u0026rsquo;s tags are up to date with your current phone number. Travel is the worst time for a tag with an old number.\nMicrochip info — Know your microchip number and make sure your contact info is current in the registry. Takes 5 minutes to check online.\n✅ The Quick Packing Checklist If you\u0026rsquo;re in a hurry, here\u0026rsquo;s the minimum:\nEssential Why 🚗 Seat cover Protect your car 💧 Water bottle with bowl Hydration at rest stops 💩 Poop bags (lots) Don\u0026rsquo;t run out 🛏️ Blanket Comfort + furniture protection 🦴 Treats Bribes work 🦮 Leash Obviously 📋 Vaccination records Hotels may ask Everything else is nice to have but not essential for a weekend trip.\n🐾 Where I\u0026rsquo;ve Used This Stuff Most recently, Ansel and I did 5 nights in Panama City Beach — about a 5-hour drive from Jacksonville. This packing list kept us covered the whole trip.\nThe seat cover handled sandy paws after the beach, the water bottle was a lifesaver at rest stops, and the blanket made the hotel room feel like home.\n🛒 My Gear Recommendations Here\u0026rsquo;s what I personally use:\nItem What I Use Notes Seat cover Waterproof hammock-style Covers doors too Water bottle Bottle with flip-up bowl Cup holder friendly Crate Gunner G1 Pricey but bombproof First aid kit Pre-made pet kit + Benadryl Check with your vet on dosage Blanket Travel fleece blanket Smells like home Have a road trip essential I missed?

Once you hit that number, Diamond status kicks in within a few weeks.\nNow: I carry the Hilton Aspire card, which gives you automatic Diamond status just for having the card. No spending threshold, no stays required — you\u0026rsquo;re Diamond from day one.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re serious about hotel travel, the Aspire is the easier path. If you\u0026rsquo;re already putting significant spend on a Surpass card, you might hit Diamond that way first.\n⭐ Diamond Status Benefits Here\u0026rsquo;s what you actually get:\nBenefit What It Means 🛏️ Room upgrades Up to 1-bedroom suites, based on availability 🍳 Daily food \u0026amp; beverage credit At U.S. properties (or free breakfast internationally) 🍸 Executive lounge access Free breakfast, snacks, drinks (where available) ⏰ Late checkout Sleep in, no rush 💯 100% bonus points Double the base points on every stay 🌙 5th night free Book 4 nights with points, get the 5th free 📶 Premium WiFi Fastest speeds in the hotel ✅ 48-hour room guarantee Guaranteed room if booked 48+ hours ahead 🎁 Welcome amenities Snacks, water bottles, treats at check-in (varies by property) 🏨 The Perks I Actually Use Room Upgrades This is the big one. As a Diamond member, I\u0026rsquo;ve been upgraded to suites multiple times — including an ocean-view suite at the Embassy Suites in Panama City Beach. More space means more room for the dog to spread out, and a balcony is a game-changer for morning coffee while Ansel watches the beach.\nPro tip: When you book, add a note requesting an upgrade. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee anything, but it puts you on their radar.\nDaily Food \u0026amp; Beverage Credit At most U.S. Hilton properties, Diamond members get a daily F\u0026amp;B credit instead of free breakfast. The amount varies by brand (usually $15–$25 per person), and it applies to you plus one guest.\n💡 Pro tip: These credits stack. Staying 3 nights? That\u0026rsquo;s 3 days of credits you can use whenever — save them up and have a nice dinner on your last night, or use them at the bar.\nLate Checkout When you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a dog, late checkout is clutch. No rushing to pack up and get the dog out by 11am. I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten 2pm checkout at most properties just by asking at the front desk.\nExecutive Lounge Access Where available, Diamond members can access the executive lounge for free breakfast, evening appetizers, and drinks. These are more common at international properties — in the U.S., they\u0026rsquo;re hit or miss. But when you find one, it\u0026rsquo;s a nice quiet spot to grab coffee or a snack.\nWelcome Amenities This varies by property, but I\u0026rsquo;ve received complimentary water bottles, snacks, and even treats for Ansel at check-in. Small touches that make you feel recognized.\n🎯 Ways to Earn Diamond Status Method Requirement 💳 Hilton Aspire card Automatic — just have the card 💳 Hilton Surpass card Spend $40,000 in a calendar year 🛏️ Stays 30 stays in a calendar year 🌙 Nights 60 nights in a calendar year ⭐ Base points Earn 120,000 base points in a calendar year For most people, the credit card path is the easiest. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re traveling for work constantly, hitting 60 nights is tough. But everyday spending on a Surpass or Aspire card? That adds up fast.\n💳 The Credit Card Shortcut Hilton Aspire ($550/year) Automatic Diamond status — no spend required Annual free night certificate $400/year in Hilton resort credits $200/year in flight credits (buy airline gift cards — they count!) 175,000 point sign-up bonus Hilton Surpass ($150/year) Gold status automatic, Diamond at $40k spend $200/year in Hilton credits ($50/quarter — use at any Hilton property, even just for dinner) Free night after $15k spend 155,000 point sign-up bonus If you want Diamond without the $550 Aspire fee, the Surpass path works — it just takes more spending. I did it for a couple years before upgrading to the Aspire.\nFor the full breakdown, check out my Best Credit Cards for Dog Travelers guide.\n🌙 Free Night Certificates: The Secret Weapon One of my favorite Diamond perks isn\u0026rsquo;t technically a Diamond perk — it\u0026rsquo;s the free night certificates from the Aspire card. But here\u0026rsquo;s what most people don\u0026rsquo;t realize:\nThese certificates work at almost any Hilton property.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve used mine at resorts where rooms go for $400–$500/night. Some people have used them at properties charging $1,000+ per night. The certificate covers one standard night, regardless of the cash price.\nSo while you\u0026rsquo;re earning Diamond status and racking up points, those free night certificates are quietly saving you hundreds of dollars per year.\n🐕 Why Diamond Matters for Dog Travelers Here\u0026rsquo;s why I think Diamond status is especially valuable when you\u0026rsquo;re traveling with a dog:\nSuite upgrades = more space. A regular hotel room with a 70-pound dog feels cramped. A suite with a separate living area? Much better.\nLate checkout = less stress. Morning potty breaks, packing up dog gear, loading the car — it all takes longer with a dog. Late checkout gives you breathing room.\nF\u0026amp;B credits = save money. Pet fees add up. Having your meals partially covered helps offset those costs.\nWelcome amenities. Some properties include dog treats or pet welcome packages for Diamond members. It\u0026rsquo;s not guaranteed, but it happens.\n📅 What\u0026rsquo;s Coming: Diamond Reserve (2026) Hilton is adding a new tier above Diamond starting January 2026 — Diamond Reserve. It requires 80 nights or 40 stays PLUS $18,000 in eligible spend.\nThe perks include confirmable suite upgrades at booking, guaranteed 4pm late checkout, and 120% bonus points. For most travelers, regular Diamond will still be the goal — but it\u0026rsquo;s good to know what\u0026rsquo;s coming.\nThe good news: nothing changes for current Diamond members. All the existing benefits stay the same.\n✅ The Bottom Line Diamond status makes hotel travel more comfortable — especially with a dog. The upgrades, late checkout, and F\u0026amp;B credits add real value, and the credit card path makes it accessible even if you\u0026rsquo;re not a road warrior.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re already staying at Hilton properties and putting spend on a Hilton card, Diamond is within reach. And once you have it, you\u0026rsquo;ll wonder how you traveled without it.\nHave questions about earning or using Diamond status?

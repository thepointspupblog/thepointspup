<strong>Tabatha & Oakleigh</strong> · Holiday Inn Resort Orlando Lake Buena Vista
<br><br>
<em>"Finally used my IHG points for something! 3 nights near Disney with Oakleigh (my 40 lb lab) and it was so easy. I was nervous about booking with a dog but they didn't even blink. Front desk gave her a treat and showed us where the little grass area was for potty breaks. Didn't pay a dime for the room 🙌"</em>

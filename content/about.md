## Hey, I'm Dani 👋

I'm a software engineer based in Jacksonville, Florida — and I haven't paid for a hotel stay in over 3 years.

A few years ago, a friend introduced me to credit card points and hotel loyalty programs. I went down the rabbit hole, learned the system inside and out, and built a strategy that keeps me traveling without spending cash on hotels. Since then, I've booked **25+ free nights at Hilton properties alone** — saving thousands of dollars along the way.

Between Hilton Honors points, free night certificates, and stacking welcome offers, I've turned loyalty programs into a reliable way to travel for free.

## Why Dog Travel?

This is Ansel — my 2-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer/Lab mix. He's 70 pounds of energy, curiosity, and enthusiasm for literally everything. He loves hiking, chasing birds, meeting new people, and going *anywhere* that isn't the house.

He's well-trained enough that I can take him to restaurants, breweries, and patios without any issues. But I wanted more for us — road trips, beach weekends, and new places to explore together.

The problem? Flying with a 70-pound dog isn't really an option. So I combined what I already knew about points and hotel programs with deep research on pet policies, fees, and what actually works for travelers with big dogs.

That's how ThePointsPup started — a place to share everything I've learned so other dog owners can travel more without breaking the bank.

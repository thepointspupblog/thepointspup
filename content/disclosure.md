## How ThePointsPup Makes Money

Some of the links on this site are affiliate links. That means if you click through and sign up for a credit card, book a hotel, or buy a product, I may earn a commission at no extra cost to you.

This is how I keep the site running and fund future trips to review for you.

## What This Means for You

- **You don't pay more.** Affiliate links don't add any cost to your purchase or application.
- **My opinions are my own.** I only recommend cards, hotels, and products I actually use or would use. If something isn't worth it, I'll say so.
- **I'm selective.** Not every affiliate offer makes it onto this site — just the ones that make sense for dog travelers.

## Programs I Participate In

- Credit card affiliate networks (for cards like the Hilton Aspire and Surpass)
- Amazon Associates (for dog travel gear)
- Hotel booking partners

## Questions?

If you ever want to know whether a link is an affiliate link, just ask. I'm happy to be transparent about it.

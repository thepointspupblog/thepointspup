## Say Hi 👋

Have a question about a hotel's pet policy? Want me to review a destination? Just want to chat about dogs and travel points?

I'd love to hear from you.

I do my best to respond within a few days. If you're asking about a specific hotel or trip, the more details the better — it helps me give you a useful answer.

## Things People Ask Me

**"Can you review [hotel/destination]?"**

Always open to suggestions. If it's dog-friendly and accessible by road trip from Jacksonville, it's probably on my list already — but I'm happy to bump it up.

**"What credit card should I get?"**

Honestly? It depends. How often do you travel, which hotel brands do you like, and how much do you spend on everyday stuff? There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but I'm happy to help you figure it out. Check out my [credit card guide](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers) first, then shoot me a message if you still have questions.

**"Can I send you free stuff?"**

If it's relevant to dog travel — gear, products, hotel stays — I'm open to it. Reach out and let's talk. Just know that I only feature things I'd actually use with Ansel.

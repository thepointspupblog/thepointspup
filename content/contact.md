### A Few Things I Get Asked

**"Can you review [hotel/destination]?"**
Always open to suggestions. If it's pet-friendly and accessible by road trip, it's on my radar.

**"What credit card should I get?"**
Depends on your situation — how much you travel, which hotels you prefer, and what perks matter to you. Shoot me a message and I can point you in the right direction.

**"Can I send you free stuff?"**
If it's relevant to pet travel, sure — reach out and let's talk.

### Why I Made This

When I started learning about hotel points, I was overwhelmed. There are so many cards, so many programs, and so much conflicting advice online.

I spent months figuring out what actually works for dog travelers — which hotels have the best policies, which cards are worth the annual fee, and how to maximize points without changing how I spend.

This guide is everything I wish I'd known from day one, condensed into 4 pages you can read in one sitting.

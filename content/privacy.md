## The Short Version

I collect minimal data, I don't sell your information, and I use cookies for analytics and affiliate tracking.

## Information I Collect

**If you email me:** I'll have your email address and whatever you share in your message. I use this only to respond to you.

**If you subscribe to my newsletter:** I collect your email address through Buttondown, my email service provider. I use this only to send you the content you signed up for.

**Automatically:** This site uses Google Analytics to understand how visitors use the site — things like what pages you visit, how long you stay, and what device you're using. This helps me create better content.

## Cookies

This site uses cookies for:

- **Google Analytics** — to track site usage and visitor behavior. Google Analytics may collect information about your device, browser, and approximate location. You can opt out using the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
- **Affiliate links** — when you click a credit card or product link, the affiliate program may set a cookie to track the referral.

You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but some features may not work properly.

## Affiliate Links & Third Parties

Some links on this site are affiliate links. When you click them, you may be redirected to a third-party site (like a credit card issuer or Amazon) that has its own privacy policy. I'm not responsible for their practices.

Affiliate partners I work with may include:

- Credit card affiliate networks
- Amazon Associates
- Hotel booking partners

## Your Data

I don't sell your personal information. Ever.

If you've emailed me or subscribed to my newsletter and want your information deleted, just ask.

## Changes

I may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.

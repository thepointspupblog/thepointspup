## Why Your Dog's Size Matters

Most hotel chains have weight limits (typically 50-75 lbs). If you have a larger dog, your card strategy should account for that:

- **Under 50 lbs**: You're welcome almost everywhere. Hilton and Marriott cards work great.
- **50-75 lbs**: Still good options, but check policies before booking.
- **75+ lbs**: Kimpton (IHG) is your best friend — no weight limits, no breed restrictions, no pet fees.

If weight limits are a constant headache, IHG cards or Chase Sapphire (which transfers to IHG) should be on your radar.

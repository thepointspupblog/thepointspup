This one I can actually vouch for — I've stayed at the Embassy Suites Panama City Beach with Ansel and wrote a [full trip report](/posts/pcb-embassy-suites-review/) about it. So instead of just researching from my couch, I'm sharing what I actually experienced.

Short version: it's a great setup for traveling with a dog, the location is perfect, and I booked the whole thing on points.

## My Pick: Embassy Suites by Hilton Panama City Beach Resort

| | |
|---|---|
| **Pet fee** | $75 (1-4 nights) / $125 (5+ nights) |
| **Weight limit** | 75 lbs per pet |
| **# of pets** | 2 dogs or cats |
| **Breed restrictions** | None |
| **Distance to beach** | 5-minute walk |
| **Book free with** | Hilton Honors points |

The hotel is right by Pier Park, across the street from the beach. Not technically beachfront, but close enough that you can walk to the sand in five minutes. And here's the best part: **Dog Beach is walking distance**. It's a designated dog-friendly beach right across from Pier Park — you can see the "Welcome to Dog Beach" sign from Margaritaville.

We barely moved the car all week. The beach, Pier Park, restaurants — everything was within walking distance.

## The Pet Policy Details

Embassy Suites PCB is genuinely dog-friendly, not just "we tolerate dogs" friendly:

- **75 lb weight limit per pet** — Ansel is 70 lbs, so he squeaked in
- **2 pets max** — Dogs or cats
- **No breed restrictions** — They didn't ask or care
- **Designated dog areas on property** — Multiple spots with poop bag stations
- **Dogs NOT allowed at the pool** — Plan around this (more below)

The room itself was a suite with a separate living area, which is nice when you're sharing space with a dog. We got upgraded to a king suite with an ocean view and a balcony — Ansel spent every morning out there watching the beach. If you have Hilton Diamond status, request an upgrade when you book.

## One Thing Nobody Tells You

**There's only one elevator.**

If you're traveling with a dog — especially one who needs to go out first thing in the morning — request a room close to the elevator. I didn't think to ask, and our first morning involved a very long hallway walk with an increasingly urgent pup.

Lesson learned. Ask for a room near the elevator.

## How to Book It Free

I used Hilton Honors points plus a free night certificate to book 5 nights. Here's the trick: **when you book 4 nights with points, the 5th night is free**. That's a built-in 20% discount.

The only thing I paid out of pocket? Tipping the valet.

**The math:**
- The [Hilton Surpass card](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/#-hilton-honors-american-express-surpass) has a 130,000 point sign-up bonus
- Embassy Suites typically runs 40,000-60,000 points per night
- That's 3-4 free nights from one sign-up bonus
- Add the 5th night free benefit and you're looking at a full week for minimal cost

## What to Do With Your Dog

### Dog Beach

This is the main attraction. A designated dog-friendly beach right across from Pier Park, walking distance from the hotel. The Gulf water is that unreal turquoise color, the sand is white, and your dog can actually be there with you.

Most Florida beaches have dog restrictions or ban them entirely. This one doesn't.

### Dog-Friendly Restaurants

PCB has a ton of restaurants with dog-friendly patios, and most are walking distance from the hotel:

- **Margaritaville** — Great views, they didn't bat an eye at a 70-pound dog under the table
- **Pier Park restaurants** — Multiple options with outdoor seating
- **Runaway Island** — Waterfront dining, dog-friendly patio

### Pier Park

Huge outdoor shopping area right next to the hotel — literally a few minutes walk. Lots of stores, restaurants, and people who want to pet your dog. Ansel found his way onto a Ron Jon surfboard for a photo op.

## The Pool Problem (And How to Solve It)

Dogs aren't allowed at the pool. If you want pool time, you have two options:

**Option 1: Coordinate with a travel partner**
One of you hangs with the dog while the other gets pool time.

**Option 2: Use daycare or grooming**

- **PetSmart in Pier Park** — Right next door. I dropped Ansel off here for a grooming session so I could spend a few hours at the pool.
- **ZOOMIES Pet Hotel** — Full daycare and boarding. Book ahead, especially on weekends.
- **Dagny and Dexter's** — Another solid daycare option nearby.

I'd recommend booking daycare in advance if you know you'll want pool time.

## The Bottom Line

Embassy Suites PCB is one of my favorite dog-friendly hotel experiences in Florida. The location is perfect — walking distance to Dog Beach, Pier Park, and restaurants. The pet policy is reasonable (75 lb limit, no breed restrictions). And you can book the whole thing on Hilton points.

Just remember: request a room near the elevator, and book daycare ahead if you want pool time.

Living in Jacksonville means you're surrounded by beach towns worth exploring with your dog. Some are close enough for a lazy lunch. Others are worth a full weekend. Here are the spots Ansel and I keep coming back to.

## Jacksonville Beach
**Drive time:** 25 minutes

You don't have to go far. Jax Beach has a ton of dog-friendly restaurants — over 40 according to BringFido — so finding a patio that welcomes your pup is never a problem.

One favorite is **Salt Life Food Shack**, just three blocks from the beach. Dogs are welcome on the downstairs patio, and they'll bring out a water bowl without you asking. Great surf-and-turf menu with tacos, sushi rolls, and fresh seafood. It's casual, breezy, and Ansel always gets compliments from other diners.

**Pro tip:** Go for a late lunch to beat the crowds. The patio fills up fast on weekends.

## Amelia Island
**Drive time:** 45 minutes

This is one of the most dog-friendly spots in the area. The beaches allow leashed dogs, downtown Fernandina Beach has plenty of dog-friendly patios, and the whole island has a relaxed, walkable vibe. Great for a day trip or a quick overnight.

One spot I always recommend is **The Patio at 5th and Ash** — a casual American bistro with a beautiful outdoor patio under oak trees draped in Spanish moss. They're genuinely dog-friendly and even have a dog menu with homemade biscuits. Ansel was *very* focused on earning one.

**Pro tip:** If you're staying overnight, check out the Hilton properties on the island. Some are pet-friendly and bookable on points. *(See my [credit cards guide](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers) for how I earn free nights.)*

## Palm Coast / Flagler Beach
**Drive time:** 1 hour 15 minutes

Flagler Beach is low-key and locals love it. Dogs are allowed on the beach (leashed), and the pier area has a few casual spots to grab food. It's less crowded than Daytona and has more of a small-town feel.

This is a good "decompress" destination — not a ton of activities, just beach, food, and chill. Sometimes that's exactly what you need.

## New Smyrna Beach
**Drive time:** 2 hours

NSB has a great mix of beach access and dog-friendly dining. The vibe is artsy and laid-back — lots of murals, local shops, and good food.

One spot I always stop at is **Yellow Dog Eats** — a funky sandwich shop with a big outdoor patio where dogs are welcome. The food is creative (think smoked meats, interesting sandwiches), and the whole place just feels like it was made for people who travel with their dogs.

*He's very polite about sharing. Usually.*

## Daytona Beach
**Drive time:** 1 hour 45 minutes

Daytona is hit or miss for dogs — the main beach doesn't allow them during peak hours, but there are designated dog-friendly areas. The boardwalk area has some pet-friendly patios, and it's a good base if you want to explore the surrounding towns.

Honestly, I usually skip Daytona proper and head to NSB or Flagler instead. But if you're in the area, it's worth a stop.

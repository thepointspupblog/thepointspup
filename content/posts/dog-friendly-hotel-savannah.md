Savannah might be the most dog-friendly city I've researched. With 22 historic squares perfect for walks, outdoor dining everywhere, and hotels that actually welcome big dogs, it's basically designed for traveling with your pup.

Here's everything you need to know about visiting Savannah with your dog.

## My Hotel Pick: Kimpton Brice Hotel

**Why it's the best for large dogs:** No weight limits, no pet fees, no breed restrictions. Their motto is "if it fits through the door, we welcome it." That's rare.

**The details:**
- **Pet fee:** None
- **Weight limit:** None
- **Number of pets:** No limit stated
- **Cats:** Yes, allowed
- **Left alone:** Yes, well-behaved pets can be left unattended

**What makes it special:** The Kimpton Brice goes beyond just allowing dogs. Your pup can join you at the nightly wine reception, and they have a dedicated alcove near the restaurant with tables specifically for guests with dogs. There's a pet relief area on property and a park with waste stations across the street.

**Location:** In the Historic District, a block from the Savannah Riverfront. Washington Square is a 3-minute walk for potty breaks.

**Book with points:** Use IHG One Rewards points (Kimpton is part of IHG). Rates vary but expect 40,000-60,000 points per night.

## Runner-Up: Thompson Savannah (Hyatt)

If you want something newer and more upscale, the Thompson Savannah is excellent for dogs.

**The details:**
- **Pet fee:** None
- **Weight limit:** None  
- **Number of pets:** 2 dogs max
- **Cats:** No
- **Left alone:** No, dogs cannot be left unattended

**What makes it special:** They have an outdoor dog exploration area with tunnels and grassy mounds for your pup to play. The hotel is on the riverwalk, so you have a wide waterfront path right outside for walks. Dogs are welcome at Bar By Fleeting (the lobby bar) and outdoor dining areas.

**Heads up:** There's a $40 resort fee per night. Dogs aren't allowed in the main restaurant (Fleeting) or rooftop bar, only service animals.

**Book with points:** Use World of Hyatt points. Thompson properties typically run 20,000-25,000 points per night.

## Other Options by Budget

**Budget-friendly:**
- **La Quinta Savannah Midtown** — Pets stay free, no weight limit
- **Tru by Hilton Savannah Midtown** — 2 pets up to 100 lbs, $75 fee

**Mid-range:**
- **Staybridge Suites Historic District (IHG)** — 2 pets up to 80 lbs, $75 fee, ground floor rooms only

**Splurge:**

## ⚠️ Important: Dogs Are NOT Allowed on Tybee Island Beaches

This is the biggest thing to know before you go. Tybee Island is Savannah's beach — just 20 minutes away — but **dogs are completely banned from all Tybee beaches, all year round.** The fine is $300.

This isn't a seasonal restriction. It's a full ban to protect loggerhead sea turtles and migratory birds.

**Your options:**
- **Tybee Island Dog Parks** — There are two fenced dog parks near River's End Campground (one for small dogs, one for large)
- **Little Tybee Island** — Dogs allowed, but it's only accessible by boat or kayak
- **Jekyll Island** — About 1.5 hours south, dogs allowed on most beaches year-round (must be leashed)
- **St. Simons Island** — About 1.5 hours south, dogs allowed before 9am and after 6pm in summer, anytime off-season

If beach time with your dog is the priority, consider Jekyll Island or St. Simons instead of Savannah.

## The Bottom Line

Savannah is genuinely one of the best cities for traveling with a dog. The walkable Historic District, abundance of shady squares, outdoor dining culture, and hotels that actually welcome big dogs make it easy.

Just remember: no dogs on Tybee beaches. Plan around that and you'll have an amazing trip.

**My pick:** The Kimpton Brice for its no-fee, no-weight-limit policy and genuinely dog-welcoming atmosphere. Book with IHG points if you have them.

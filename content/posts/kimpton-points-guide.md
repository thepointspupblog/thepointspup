If you've traveled with a large dog, you know the drill: call ahead, confirm the weight limit, hope they don't give you a hard time at check-in. It gets old.

Kimpton doesn't play that game. Their policy is simple: if your pet fits through the door, they're welcome. No weight limit. No breed restrictions. No pet fee. Ever.

It's the most genuinely pet-friendly hotel chain I've found — and you can book stays completely free using credit card points.

## Why Kimpton for Pet Travelers

Kimpton became the first major hotel chain to go pet-friendly back in 1992. They weren't just tolerating pets — they built it into the brand. Here's what you actually get:

- **No pet fee** — not even for extended stays
- **No weight or breed restrictions** — Great Danes, pit bulls, whatever
- **Pet amenities included** — loaner beds, bowls, treats at check-in
- **Pet-friendly wine hour** — the nightly hosted reception welcomes dogs
- **Director of Pet Relations** at some properties — yes, it's a dog

With 77+ locations in the US and a few international properties, you've got solid coverage in most major cities.

The catch? Kimpton is a boutique brand, so rates tend to run higher than your typical Hilton or Marriott. That's where points come in.

## How to Earn IHG Points for Kimpton

Kimpton is part of IHG (InterContinental Hotels Group), so you book using **IHG One Rewards points**. There are two main ways to stack up enough points for free stays:

1. IHG credit cards (direct earning)
2. Chase Ultimate Rewards (transfer partner)

---

## Option 1: IHG Credit Cards

If you stay at IHG properties regularly, their co-branded Chase cards make sense.

### 💎 IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card

**The card for frequent IHG travelers.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Annual Fee** | $99 |
| **Sign-Up Bonus** | 140,000 points after $3,000 spend in 3 months |
| **Free Night** | 1/year at properties up to 40,000 points |
| **Status** | Platinum Elite |

That 140,000-point bonus is enough for 2-4 free nights at most Kimptons, depending on the property and dates.

**Key perks:**
- 💳 26x points at IHG properties
- ✈️ 5x on travel, gas, and restaurants
- 🌙 4th night free on award stays (book 4, pay for 3)
- 🎁 Annual free night certificate

**💡 Pro tip:** The 4th night free benefit is huge. If you're booking a 4-night Kimpton stay with points, you're effectively getting 25% off. A 200,000-point redemption becomes 150,000.

**How the $99 fee pays for itself:**

| Perk | Value |
|------|-------|
| Annual free night certificate | $200+ |
| 4th night free on award stays | Varies |
| **Total** | **$200+** |

---

### 🆓 IHG One Rewards Traveler Credit Card

**The no-risk starting point.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Annual Fee** | $0 |
| **Sign-Up Bonus** | 80,000 points after $2,000 spend in 3 months |
| **Free Night** | None |
| **Status** | None |

If you're not sure how often you'll stay at IHG properties, this is a safe way to start earning points. 80,000 points for $2,000 in spending with no annual fee is solid.

**Key perks:**
- 💳 17x points at IHG properties
- 🍽️ 3x on dining, gas, and groceries
- 🌙 4th night free on award stays (yes, even with the no-fee card)

---

## Option 2: Chase Ultimate Rewards Transfer

If you want more flexibility, **Chase Ultimate Rewards points transfer 1:1 to IHG**. This is my preferred approach because I can use the same points for flights, other hotels, or cash back if I need to.

Cards that earn transferable Ultimate Rewards:

### Chase Sapphire Preferred

| | |
|---|---|
| **Annual Fee** | $95 |
| **Sign-Up Bonus** | 60,000 points after $4,000 spend in 3 months |

- 3x on dining, select streaming, and online groceries
- 2x on travel
- Points transfer to 14+ airline and hotel partners including IHG

### Chase Sapphire Reserve

| | |
|---|---|
| **Annual Fee** | $550 |
| **Sign-Up Bonus** | 60,000 points after $4,000 spend in 3 months |

- 3x on dining and travel
- $300 annual travel credit (effectively reduces fee to $250)
- Priority Pass lounge access
- Points worth 1.5x when booked through Chase Travel

**💡 Pro tip:** If you already have a Sapphire card for travel, you don't need an IHG card. Just transfer points when you find a Kimpton you want to book. Transfers are instant.

## How Many Points Do Kimpton Stays Cost?

IHG uses dynamic pricing, so point costs vary by property, date, and demand. Here's what I've seen:

| Demand | Points/Night | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Off-peak | 20,000–35,000 | Midweek in shoulder season |
| Standard | 40,000–60,000 | Most weekends |
| Peak | 70,000–100,000+ | Holidays, special events |

For reference, I searched Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver for a random February weekend and found award nights around 45,000 points. Paid rates were $280/night, so that's solid value.

**Remember:** If you have the IHG Premier card, book 4 nights and the 4th is free. That 180,000-point booking becomes 135,000.

## Best Kimpton Properties for Dog Travelers

Not every Kimpton is equal when it comes to dog-friendliness (location matters). Here are some I've researched or have on my list:

### 🏔️ Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver
Downtown location with easy access to trails. The wine hour is popular, and staff are known for going above and beyond for pets. Close to Cherry Creek Dog Park.

### 🌳 Kimpton Brice Hotel (Savannah)
Enclosed courtyard that's perfect for the evening wine reception with your pup. Walking distance to Forsyth Park — one of the most dog-friendly parks in the South.

### 🌴 Kimpton Rowan Palm Springs
Near several dog parks and surrounded by pet-friendly restaurant patios. Great for a desert getaway when it's not 115°F.

### 🏔️ Kimpton Arras (Asheville)
Gateway to Blue Ridge Mountains hiking. Asheville is extremely dog-friendly, with tons of outdoor dining and brewery patios that welcome dogs.

### 🍺 Kimpton Journeyman (Milwaukee)
Dedicated pet-friendly floors. Good urban location for exploring with your dog.

## Which Card Should You Get?

| You... | Get This | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| 🆕 New to points | IHG Traveler | 80k bonus, no fee, no risk |
| 🏨 Stay at IHG often | IHG Premier | 140k bonus, free night, 4th night free |
| ✈️ Want flexibility | Chase Sapphire Preferred | Transfer to IHG + 13 other partners |
| 💎 Already have Hilton cards | Chase Sapphire Preferred | Add IHG as a transfer option |

If you're already in the Hilton ecosystem (like me), the Sapphire Preferred is a good complement. You keep your Hilton setup for most trips and transfer Chase points to IHG when you want to book a Kimpton.

## The Bottom Line

Kimpton is the best hotel chain for pet travelers, full stop. No other major brand matches their policy — no fees, no weight limits, no breed restrictions, and actual pet amenities beyond a sad bowl at the front desk.

The only downside is price. Kimpton properties aren't cheap. But that's exactly why points matter here. A $300/night boutique hotel stay feels very different when it costs you 45,000 points you earned from everyday spending.

If you're traveling with a large dog and want a stress-free check-in experience, Kimpton should be on your radar. And now you know how to book it free.

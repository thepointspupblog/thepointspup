If you've been sitting on a credit card application, the clock is ticking.

**All four Hilton Amex card bonuses expire January 14, 2026.** That's less than three weeks to lock in some of the best hotel credit card offers of the year.

But here's the thing most points blogs won't tell you: earning a huge bonus doesn't matter if you can't actually use those points at hotels that welcome your dog. And if your dog is over 50 lbs? Your options shrink fast.

I've spent the last year figuring out which hotel programs actually work for traveling with Ansel, my 70-lb GSP/Lab mix. Here's exactly which expiring and current bonuses are worth grabbing — and which hotels you'll actually be able to book.

## Why This Matters for Dog Owners

Most hotel chains cap pets at 50-75 lbs. Some have breed restrictions. Almost all charge fees.

When you're earning points through credit cards, you need to know:
1. Can I actually book a dog-friendly room with these points?
2. Will they accept my specific dog?
3. What's the pet fee going to cost me on top of the "free" stay?

Let's break down each program.

## The Hilton Bonuses Expiring January 14th

All four Hilton Amex cards have elevated bonuses right now, and they all expire the same day. Here's what's on the table:

### 💎 Hilton Honors American Express Aspire

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bonus** | 175,000 points after $6,000 spend in 6 months |
| **Annual Fee** | $550 |
| **Status** | Automatic Diamond (top tier) |
| **Expires** | January 14, 2026 |

**The dog-friendly breakdown:**
- ✅ Works at ALL Hilton brands — every single one accepts dogs
- ✅ Most properties allow dogs up to 75 lbs
- ✅ No breed restrictions at the corporate level
- ✅ Diamond status = room upgrades (more space for your pup) + late checkout (crucial for morning walks)
- 💰 Pet fees: $50-$95 per stay depending on brand

**What 175,000 points gets you:** 3-5 free nights at most dog-friendly Hilton properties. I used my points for a [5-night stay at Embassy Suites Panama City Beach](/posts/pcb-embassy-suites-review/) — the only thing I paid was the $125 pet fee.

**Worth it if:** You travel frequently and want the premium perks. The $550 fee sounds steep, but between the annual free night certificate ($300+ value), $400 in resort credits, and $200 in flight credits, it pays for itself.

### 🥇 Hilton Honors American Express Surpass

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bonus** | 155,000 points after $3,000 spend in 6 months |
| **Annual Fee** | $150 |
| **Status** | Automatic Gold |
| **Expires** | January 14, 2026 |

**The dog-friendly breakdown:**
Same hotel access as the Aspire — all Hilton brands, 75 lb limit at most properties, no breed restrictions.

**What 155,000 points gets you:** 3-4 free nights at most properties.

**Worth it if:** You're a regular traveler but don't need Diamond status. This is the sweet spot card — solid bonus, reasonable fee, and $200/year in Hilton credits that more than cover the annual fee.

**Pro tip:** You get a free night certificate after spending $15k in a calendar year. If you're close, push some spending to this card before December 31st.

### 🆓 Hilton Honors American Express (No Fee)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bonus** | 100,000 points after $2,000 spend in 6 months |
| **Annual Fee** | $0 |
| **Status** | Silver |
| **Expires** | January 14, 2026 |

**Worth it if:** You're new to points and want zero risk. 100,000 points for $2,000 in spending with no annual fee is excellent. You still get the 5th night free on award stays, which is a 20% discount on any redemption of 5+ nights.

---

### 💼 Hilton Honors American Express Business

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bonus** | 175,000 points after $8,000 spend in 6 months |
| **Annual Fee** | $195 |
| **Status** | Automatic Gold |
| **Expires** | January 14, 2026 |

**Worth it if:** You have a business (even a side hustle counts) and can meet the higher spend requirement. This is the highest Hilton bonus available right now.

---

### The Hilton Bottom Line for Dog Owners

**Pros:**
- Every Hilton brand welcomes dogs
- 75 lb weight limit at most properties
- No breed restrictions
- Huge footprint — 7,000+ hotels means you'll find options almost anywhere

**Cons:**
- Pet fees ($50-$95) still apply on award stays
- Some properties cap at 50 lbs — always call ahead
- If your dog is over 75 lbs, you're out of luck

**If your dog is under 75 lbs:** Hilton is probably your best bet for coverage and consistency. Grab the Surpass or Aspire before January 14th.

**If your dog is over 75 lbs:** Keep reading.

## IHG: The Secret Weapon for Large Dogs

Here's what most points blogs miss: **IHG owns Kimpton, and Kimpton has no weight limits, no breed restrictions, and no pet fees.**

If you have a Great Dane, a German Shepherd, a pit bull, or any other large or "restricted" breed, Kimpton is your golden ticket.

### 🏨 IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bonus** | 140,000 points after $3,000 spend in 3 months |
| **Annual Fee** | $99 |
| **Status** | Automatic Platinum Elite |
| **Free Night** | Annual certificate (up to 40,000 points) |

**The dog-friendly breakdown:**
- ✅ Kimpton: NO weight limit, NO pet fee, NO breed restrictions
- ✅ Candlewood Suites: Up to 80 lbs, $75-$150 fee
- ✅ Staybridge Suites: Up to 50 lbs (varies), ~$75/week
- ⚠️ Holiday Inn/Hotel Indigo: Varies widely by property

**What 140,000 points gets you:** 3-4 free nights at most Kimptons, depending on dates and location.

**The killer perk:** 4th night free on award stays. Book 4 nights with points, pay for 3. That's 25% off every longer stay.

**Worth it if:** You have a large dog OR you want guaranteed pet-friendly stays with no fees. The $99 annual fee pays for itself with the free night certificate alone.

### 🆓 IHG One Rewards Traveler Credit Card

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bonus** | 80,000 points after $2,000 spend in 3 months |
| **Annual Fee** | $0 |
| **Status** | Silver Elite |

**Worth it if:** You want access to Kimpton redemptions without committing to an annual fee. You still get the 4th night free benefit even on the no-fee card.

---

### The IHG/Kimpton Bottom Line for Dog Owners

**Pros:**
- Kimpton = no weight limits, no fees, no restrictions (the best pet policy in the industry)
- 4th night free on award stays is huge
- Lower annual fee than Hilton premium cards

**Cons:**
- Only ~77 Kimpton properties (mostly in major cities)
- Other IHG brands have inconsistent pet policies
- Smaller footprint than Hilton

**If your dog is over 75 lbs:** Get this card. Kimpton is basically the only major hotel chain that will reliably accept your large dog with zero hassle.

## Marriott: Best Sign-Up Bonus Overall

The Marriott Bonvoy Boundless has one of the best sign-up bonuses in the hotel card space right now.

### 🏨 Marriott Bonvoy Boundless

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bonus** | 3 Free Night Awards (each up to 50,000 points) after $3,000 spend in 3 months |
| **Annual Fee** | $95 |
| **Status** | Automatic Silver Elite |
| **Free Night** | Annual certificate (up to 35,000 points) |

That's potentially **150,000 points worth of free nights** right out of the gate — the highest value sign-up bonus available.

**The dog-friendly breakdown:**
- ✅ TownePlace Suites: Often accepts dogs up to 100 lbs
- ✅ Residence Inn: All locations pet-friendly, weight limits vary
- ✅ Element by Westin: All locations pet-friendly
- ⚠️ Other brands: Highly inconsistent — always call ahead
- 💰 Pet fees: $75-$150 per stay

**What 3 free nights gets you:** A long weekend at solid Marriott properties. The free night certificates work at properties up to 50,000 points per night.

**Worth it if:** You want the biggest immediate value and don't mind calling ahead to verify pet policies. TownePlace Suites is particularly good for large dogs.

**The catch:** Marriott's pet policies vary more than any other chain. One TownePlace might allow 100 lb dogs, another might cap at 50 lbs. You MUST call the specific property before booking.

## Chase Sapphire: The Flexible Option

If you want flexibility to book across multiple hotel programs, the Chase Sapphire Preferred is worth considering.

### 💳 Chase Sapphire Preferred

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bonus** | 75,000 points after $5,000 spend in 3 months |
| **Annual Fee** | $95 |

**Why it matters for dog travelers:** Chase Ultimate Rewards points transfer 1:1 to:
- IHG (for Kimpton stays)
- Hyatt
- Marriott

So you're not locked into one hotel program. See a Kimpton where you're going? Transfer to IHG. No Kimpton available? Transfer to Hyatt or Marriott instead.

**Worth it if:** You want maximum flexibility and don't want to commit to a single hotel chain. The 75,000-point bonus is solid, and the $95 fee is reasonable.

## Quick Comparison: Which Card Should You Grab?

| Card | Bonus | Annual Fee | Best For | Expires |
|------|-------|------------|----------|---------|
| **Hilton Aspire** | 175,000 pts | $550 | Frequent travelers, premium perks | Jan 14 |
| **Hilton Surpass** | 155,000 pts | $150 | Regular travelers, best value | Jan 14 |

## My Recommendation

Here's what I'd do based on your dog's size:

### If your dog is under 50 lbs:
**Grab the Hilton Surpass before January 14th.** You'll have access to 7,000+ hotels, consistent policies, and a 155,000-point bonus that's enough for 3-4 free nights. The $200/year in Hilton credits more than covers the $150 annual fee.

### If your dog is 50-75 lbs:
**Same answer — Hilton Surpass.** Most Hilton properties accept dogs up to 75 lbs, but always call ahead to confirm the specific property's limit.

### If your dog is over 75 lbs:
**Get the IHG Premier for Kimpton access.** Kimpton is the only major chain that will reliably accept your large dog with no questions asked. The 140,000-point bonus gets you 3-4 free nights, and the 4th night free benefit makes longer stays even more valuable.

### If you want maximum flexibility:
**Pair the Chase Sapphire Preferred with one hotel card.** This lets you transfer points to IHG for Kimpton stays when available, or to Hyatt/Marriott when Kimpton isn't an option.

### If you're brand new to points:
**Start with the no-fee Hilton card.** 100,000 points for $2,000 in spending, zero risk. See if hotel points work for your travel style before committing to annual fees.

## The Clock Is Ticking

The Hilton bonuses expire January 14, 2026. That's less than three weeks.

If you've been thinking about a Hilton card, don't wait until the new year — these offers could drop after the deadline, and there's no guarantee when (or if) they'll return to these levels.

I've been running this setup for a while now: Hilton Surpass for everyday Hilton stays, IHG Premier for Kimpton when I need guaranteed large-dog acceptance. Between them, I've got dog-friendly options almost anywhere, and I haven't paid for a hotel room in years.

The pet fees still sting. But paying $75-$125 for a pet fee on a $200-$400/night room? That math works out pretty well.

## Which Card Are You Grabbing?

I'd love to hear what you're thinking. Are you team Hilton? Going for the Kimpton route? Or holding out for something else?

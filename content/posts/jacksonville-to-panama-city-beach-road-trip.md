The drive from Jacksonville to Panama City Beach is about 5-7 hours depending on how many stops you make — and if you're traveling with a dog, you're going to make a lot of stops. Here's what I learned driving this route with Ansel, my 70-pound GSP/Lab mix.

## The Route

From Jacksonville (I started in Callahan), you'll take I-10 West through Lake City, Tallahassee, and then head south on US-231 into Panama City Beach. It's mostly highway driving with plenty of rest areas along the way.

**Distance:** ~350 miles  
**Drive time:** 5-7 hours (with dog stops)

## Best Stops Along the Way

### The Must-Stop: Busy Bee

If you only make one non-potty stop, make it **Busy Bee**. It's basically Florida's answer to Buc-ee's — spotless restrooms (seriously, some of the cleanest gas station bathrooms you'll ever see), a huge selection of snacks, jerky, fudge, and their famous Bee Bites. There's also a Burger King and Dunkin' inside if you need real food.

There are two locations on I-10:
- **Live Oak** (Exit 283) — about 1.5 hours from Jacksonville
- **Lake City** (US-41 near I-75) — slightly earlier if you're coming from the Callahan area

Both have plenty of room to walk your dog around before heading back on the road. It's worth the stop.

### Rest Areas

Florida's I-10 rest areas are well-maintained with grassy pet areas:

- **Suwannee County Rest Area** (Mile Marker 294) — Good first stop
- **Madison County Rest Area** (Mile Marker 265) — Midway point
- **Leon County Rest Area** (Mile Marker 194) — Just west of Tallahassee

All have pet areas, restrooms, and vending machines. Nothing fancy, but they get the job done.

### Coming Soon: Buc-ee's

Buc-ee's is building a massive 75,000 square foot location near Tallahassee on I-10. Once that opens, it'll be another great option. For now, Busy Bee has you covered.

## What I Packed (And What I'd Do Differently)

### What Worked

- **[Backseat cover](https://amzn.to/3XHzRt6)** — Non-negotiable. Keeps the car clean and gives your dog a non-slip surface.
- **[Travel water bottle with attached bowl](https://amzn.to/44js0FY)** — Perfect for rest stops without digging through bags.
- **[Extra poop bags](https://amzn.to/3MMo1LT)** — I always overpack. Running out at a rest area is not ideal.
- **[His favorite blanket](https://amzn.to/4q0DkiK)** — Familiar smells help anxious dogs settle.

### What I'd Do Differently: The Crate Situation

I made the mistake of bringing Ansel's wire crate to use in the hotel room. The problem? It rattled the entire drive. Every bump, every turn — rattle, rattle, rattle. Ansel is an anxious boy when it comes to weird sounds, so by the time we arrived, he was stressed and I was frustrated.

**The fix:** Get a crash-tested travel kennel that stays in the car.

The two best options:

**Gunner Kennel** — The gold standard. 5-star crash test rating from the Center for Pet Safety, double-wall construction for temperature regulation, and built like a tank. For a 70-lb dog, you'd want the Large. They're pricey (~$500+) and heavy (~72 lbs), but if safety is your priority, this is it.

**Ruffland Kennel** — The more budget-friendly option (~$300-350). Single-piece roto-molded plastic, lighter weight, and performed well in crash testing when secured against the seatback. A lot of hunters and dog sport people swear by these.

Either way, your dog rides safer and you skip the rattling nightmare. I'm upgrading before my next trip.

## Timing Tips

- **Leave early.** If you leave Jacksonville by 7am, you can be in PCB by early afternoon with plenty of stops.
- **Plan for stops every 2 hours** — or whenever your dog tells you it's time.
- **Avoid Tallahassee rush hour** if possible (typically 4-6pm).
- **The last hour** (US-231 south into PCB) is the slowest part — two-lane roads and beach traffic.

## The Bottom Line

This is an easy drive if you plan for it. Pack smart, stop at Busy Bee, and invest in a proper travel crate. Your dog (and your sanity) will thank you.

When you're traveling with a small dog, finding pet-friendly hotels is pretty straightforward. But once your pup crosses that 50-pound threshold? Suddenly half your options disappear.

I travel with Ansel, my 70-pound German Shorthaired Pointer/Lab mix. He's a lanky, well-behaved sweetheart—but on paper, he's "too big" for a lot of hotels. If you're in the same boat with your large dog, here's everything I've learned about navigating hotel weight limits.

## The Weight Limit Problem

Most hotel chains set their pet weight limits between 50-75 pounds. The logic seems to be liability and room size, but the limits often feel arbitrary. A calm 80-pound Lab is going to cause fewer issues than a hyper 30-pound terrier, but policies don't account for temperament.

Here's what you'll typically see:

- **Under 50 lbs**: Welcome almost everywhere
- **50-75 lbs**: Many options, but you'll need to check policies
- **75+ lbs**: Options get limited fast

The good news? Several hotel chains have no weight limits at all, and others are more flexible than their official policies suggest.

## Hotels with NO Weight Limits

These chains welcome dogs of any size—no awkward conversations at check-in required.

### [Kimpton Hotels](/posts/kimpton-points-guide/)
The gold standard for large dog travel. Their unofficial motto is "if they fit through the door, they're welcome." They've hosted everything from Great Danes to llamas. No pet fee, no weight limit, and many properties have a resident "Director of Pet Relations" (a very good dog). The nightly wine reception often welcomes pups too.

**Best for**: Travelers who want a boutique experience and don't mind paying more per night.

### Motel 6 / Studio 6
The most budget-friendly option for large dogs. No pet fee at Motel 6, and no weight or breed restrictions. Studio 6 (their extended stay brand) charges around $10/night but still has no size limit.

**Best for**: Road trippers who need affordable, no-questions-asked pet lodging.

### La Quinta
La Quinta used to be the holy grail—no pet fee and no weight limit. Since Wyndham acquired them, policies vary more by location. Many still have no restrictions, but some now cap at 75 pounds with a $25/night fee. Always call ahead to confirm.

**Best for**: Frequent travelers who want consistency and don't mind calling to verify.

### Red Roof Inn
No weight limit, no breed restrictions, and no pet fee. They also provide designated dog walk areas with waste bags at each location. A solid budget option that genuinely welcomes large dogs.

**Best for**: Budget road trips where you want a pet-friendly guarantee.

### Loews Hotels
All 24 Loews properties accept dogs of any size. The "Loews Loves Pets" program provides beds, bowls, treats, and even a room service menu for dogs. Fees vary by property but are typically reasonable for the upscale experience.

**Best for**: Special occasions when you want to treat yourself and your pup.

### Sonesta (All Brands)
Royal Sonesta, Sonesta Hotels, Sonesta Select, Sonesta ES Suites, and Sonesta Simply Suites all allow pets with no breed or size limit. Standard fee is $75 per stay (or $150 for stays over 7 nights).

**Best for**: Extended stays and business travel with your dog.

## Hotels with 75-80 lb Limits

If your dog is in the 50-80 pound range, these chains will likely work:

| Chain | Weight Limit | Pet Fee | Notes |
|-------|--------------|---------|-------|
| Best Western | 80 lbs per dog | ~$30/night | Policies vary by location |
| Drury Hotels | 80 lbs combined | $50/night | Up to 2 pets |
| Candlewood Suites | 80 lbs | $75-150/stay | IHG property |
| My Place Hotels | 80 lbs | $15-30/night | Midwest-focused chain |
| Extended Stay America | 36" x 36" | Varies | Measures by size, not weight! |

**Pro tip**: Extended Stay America measures dogs by dimensions rather than weight. If your dog is under 36 inches tall and 36 inches long, you're good—that covers most large breeds except giant breeds.

## What About Hilton?

Since I focus a lot on Hilton for points travel, here's the reality: most Hilton brands cap at 50-75 pounds, and it varies by property.

**Hilton brands that tend to be more flexible**:
- Home2 Suites (75 lb limit)
- Hilton Garden Inn (75 lb limit at most locations)
- Homewood Suites (75 lb limit)
- DoubleTree (varies widely—some have no limit)
- Canopy by Hilton (very pet-friendly, 50-75 lbs)

**Always call the specific property** before booking. The website might say 50 pounds, but the front desk often has discretion—especially for well-behaved dogs.

## Tips for When Your Dog Exceeds the Limit

Here's what I've learned from traveling with a dog who's technically "too big" for some policies:

### 1. Call the hotel directly
Don't just book online and hope for the best. Call the front desk, explain your dog's size and temperament, and ask if they can accommodate you. Many hotels will say yes even if the official policy says no—they care more about behavior than the number on the scale.

### 2. Be honest
Don't lie about your dog's weight. If you show up with an obviously-larger-than-stated dog, you risk being turned away. Honesty builds trust and often gets you further than trying to sneak by.

### 3. Mention good behavior
"He's 70 pounds but very calm and well-trained" goes a long way. Hotels worry about noise complaints and damage—if you can reassure them your dog won't cause issues, they're more likely to flex on the weight limit.

### 4. Offer a larger deposit
If a hotel is hesitant, offering to put down a larger refundable deposit can ease their concerns. It shows you're confident in your dog's behavior.

### 5. Book pet-friendly room types
Some hotels have designated pet rooms that can accommodate larger dogs. Ask specifically about these when you call.

### 6. Use BringFido
[BringFido](https://www.bringfido.com/) is the best resource for finding genuinely pet-friendly hotels. They verify policies and can even help negotiate weight limit exceptions through their Canine Concierge service.

### 7. Use the Hotel Pet Policy Finder

Not sure about a specific chain's policy? Use my [Hotel Pet Policy Finder](/posts/hotel-pet-policy-finder/) to quickly check weight limits and fees for any major hotel brand.

## The Reality Check

Hotels rarely actually weigh dogs. Most front desk staff will eyeball your pup and decide if they're comfortable. A well-groomed, calm dog on a leash makes a much better impression than a dog that's pulling and barking—regardless of size.

That said, don't abuse this. If a hotel says 50 pounds and you show up with a 120-pound Mastiff, you're putting the staff in an awkward position and potentially ruining it for other large-dog travelers.

## My Go-To Strategy

For road trips with Ansel, here's my approach:

1. **First choice**: La Quinta or Red Roof Inn (no restrictions, budget-friendly)
2. **If I want something nicer**: Kimpton or Loews (splurge-worthy, genuinely welcoming)
3. **If using Hilton points**: Home2 Suites or Homewood Suites (call ahead to confirm)
4. **Always**: Call the specific property before booking to confirm they'll welcome my 70-pound guy

## The Bottom Line

Traveling with a large dog takes more planning, but it's absolutely doable. The key is knowing which chains are genuinely welcoming versus which ones just tolerate pets. Stick with the no-weight-limit chains for stress-free bookings, and always call ahead when you're unsure.

Your big dog deserves adventures too. Don't let arbitrary weight limits keep you home.

Charleston is one of the most charming cities in the South — cobblestone streets, historic architecture, incredible food, and a surprisingly welcoming attitude toward dogs. Most restaurants have patios. The beaches allow dogs (with some restrictions). And the historic district is perfect for leisurely walks with your pup.

The hotel situation is a bit different here — there's no Kimpton in Charleston. But there are still great options you can book with points.

## My Pick: The Spectator Hotel

**Why this one?**

This boutique property in the French Quarter has one of the best pet policies in Charleston:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Pet fee** | $75 per stay |
| **Weight limit** | None |
| **# of pets** | 2 max |
| **Breed restrictions** | None |
| **Location** | French Quarter, downtown |
| **Book free with** | Marriott Bonvoy points |

The Spectator is part of Marriott's Autograph Collection, which means you can book it with Marriott Bonvoy points. Unlike many Charleston hotels that cap dogs at 25-40 lbs, The Spectator has **no weight limit**. That's rare for a boutique property in a historic district.

The location is ideal — walking distance to King Street shopping, the waterfront, and most of Charleston's best restaurants.

## The Pet Policy Details

- **No weight limit** — Large dogs welcome
- **No breed restrictions** — None listed
- **Pet fee** — $75 per stay (not per night)
- **Max 2 pets** — Standard for most hotels
- **Pet amenities** — Beds and bowls available on request
- **Walking** — Staff can recommend nearby parks and walking routes

---

## How to Book It Free

The Spectator is part of Marriott's Autograph Collection. Expect to pay 40,000-60,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night.

**The math:**

- The [Marriott Bonvoy Boundless card](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/) currently has a 5 free night certificate sign-up bonus
- That's potentially 5 free nights (each cert valid up to 50,000 points)
- You'd pay only the $75 pet fee

Cash rates run $300-500/night for this property, so points deliver strong value.

## What Else to Do

### Walk the Historic District

The best thing to do with a dog in Charleston is simply walk. The historic district is compact and beautiful — Rainbow Row, the Battery, South of Broad, French Quarter. Dogs must be on-leash, and most shops won't allow dogs inside, but the walking itself is the attraction.

## Other Hotels I Considered

If The Spectator doesn't work for your dates:

**Belmond Charleston Place** — Luxury property with a $150 pet fee and 25 lb weight limit. Beautiful but restrictive.

**The Vendue** — Boutique hotel with rooftop bar. Accepts dogs with varying fees. Check current policy.

**Hotel Bennett** — Gorgeous new luxury hotel on King Street. Pet-friendly but has weight limits and fees ($100+).

**Home2 Suites Charleston** — Hilton extended-stay in Mount Pleasant. 75 lb limit, ~$75 pet fee. Less central but good for longer stays with kitchens.

**Hyatt Place Charleston** — Solid option with typical Hyatt pet policies.

For large dogs with no weight limit hassle, The Spectator remains the best downtown option.

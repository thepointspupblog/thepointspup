United Airlines offers both in-cabin pet travel and a dedicated cargo program called PetSafe. But like other airlines, the rules are strict and cargo comes with significant limitations. Here's the full breakdown.

## In-Cabin Pet Policy

### What's Allowed

United allows dogs, cats, rabbits, and household birds in the cabin on most domestic flights and select international routes.

- **One carrier per passenger**
- **Small pets only** — Must fit in carrier under the seat
- **Pet stays in carrier** for the entire flight
- **Carrier counts as carry-on** — You still get one personal item

### Weight Limits

United doesn't publish a specific weight limit, but your pet + carrier must fit **completely under the seat**. Maximum carrier dimensions:

- **Soft-sided:** 17.5" L x 12" W x 7.5" H
- **Hard-sided:** 17.5" L x 12" W x 7.5" H

Realistically, this means dogs under ~15-18 lbs.

### Carrier Requirements

- Must be leak-proof and well-ventilated
- Pet must fit comfortably (able to stand and turn)
- Must stay closed during flight
- Soft-sided carriers are easier to fit under seats

## In-Cabin Fees

| Route | Fee |
|-------|-----|
| Domestic US | $150 each way |
| Canada/Mexico | $150 each way |
| Central/South America | $200 each way |
| International (where allowed) | $200+ each way |

Round-trip domestic = $300 total.

## How to Book (In-Cabin)

1. **Book your flight first** on united.com
2. **Add your pet online** — United is one of the few airlines that lets you add pets during booking or via Manage Reservations
3. **Or call United** — 1-800-864-8331
4. **Pay at check-in**

**Limit:** United restricts pets per cabin section. Add your pet early to secure a spot.

## Cargo: United PetSafe

United's **PetSafe** program is one of the more established airline cargo pet programs. It's designed for pets too large to fly in-cabin.

### How PetSafe Works

- Book through United Cargo or by calling United
- Your pet flies in a pressurized, climate-controlled cargo compartment
- You drop off at the United Cargo facility (separate from passenger terminal)
- Pick up at the destination cargo facility

### PetSafe Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Crate** | IATA-compliant, hard-sided kennel |
| **Health certificate** | Within 10 days of travel (USDA-accredited vet) |
| **Age** | Pets must be at least 8 weeks old and weaned |
| **Food/water** | Attached dishes required for flights over 4 hours |

### PetSafe Restrictions

| Restriction | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Snub-nosed breeds** | Restricted year-round |
| **Temperature embargoes** | No travel when temps below 45°F or above 85°F |
| **Connections** | Available but increase risk — direct flights recommended |
| **Seasonal suspensions** | PetSafe may suspend service during extreme weather periods |

### PetSafe Fees

Fees vary based on:
- Route
- Size of crate
- Weight of pet + crate

Starting around **$338** for domestic, potentially **$500-$1,000+** for larger pets or international routes. Contact United Cargo for a quote.

### Which Breeds Are Restricted?

PetSafe restricts **snub-nosed (brachycephalic) breeds** from cargo:

- American Bulldog, English Bulldog, French Bulldog
- Boston Terrier
- Boxer
- Pug
- Shih Tzu
- Mastiff breeds
- Pekingese
- And others

These breeds face higher respiratory risk in cargo. If you have a restricted breed that's too big for cabin travel, United is not an option.

## Tips for Flying United with Your Dog

### For In-Cabin

1. **Add your pet online** — United makes this easier than most airlines
2. **Choose window seats** — More floor space under the seat
3. **Avoid bulkhead rows** — No under-seat storage
4. **Measure your carrier** — United's limits are strict (17.5" x 12" x 7.5")
5. **Book direct flights** — Less stress for everyone

### For PetSafe Cargo

1. **Book direct flights only** — Connections add risk
2. **Avoid extreme weather** — Summer and winter embargoes are common
3. **Use a proper crate** — IATA-compliant, big enough for your dog to stand and turn
4. **Don't sedate** — Sedation is dangerous at altitude
5. **Attach a water bottle** — Freeze it before drop-off so it thaws during transit
6. **Confirm repeatedly** — Call United Cargo to verify everything before travel day

## TSA Process

Same as other airlines:

1. Remove dog from carrier before the X-ray
2. Carrier goes through the X-ray machine
3. Carry your dog through the metal detector (or body scanner)
4. Put dog back in carrier on the other side

Have treats ready to keep your dog calm.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I buy a seat for my dog on United?

No. Pets cannot occupy seats. In-cabin pets must be in a carrier under the seat. Larger pets must use PetSafe cargo.

### Can I bring two dogs?

Only if you're traveling with another person. Each passenger can bring one pet. (Exception: two very small pets may share a carrier if they fit.)

### What's the difference between PetSafe and checking a pet as baggage?

United doesn't offer "checked pet" service like some airlines. PetSafe is the only cargo option, and it's handled through United Cargo — a separate process from passenger check-in.

### Are emotional support animals free?

No. United only accommodates trained service dogs for free. Emotional support animals are treated as regular pets with full fees and restrictions.

### What about international travel?

In-cabin is available on select international routes. PetSafe serves more destinations but you'll need to research destination country import requirements (health certificates, quarantine, microchip requirements, etc.).

## The Bottom Line

United is a solid option for small dogs in the cabin. The ability to add your pet online is a nice convenience other airlines don't offer.

For larger dogs, PetSafe is available but comes with breed restrictions, weather embargoes, and higher costs. If you have a medium-to-large dog, especially a restricted breed, driving remains the most practical option.

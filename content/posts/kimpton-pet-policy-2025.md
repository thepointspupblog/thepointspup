If you've traveled with a dog — especially a big one — you know the frustration of weight limits, breed restrictions, and pet fees that cost as much as another night's stay.

Kimpton doesn't do any of that.

**Kimpton's pet policy is simple: if your pet fits through the door, they're welcome.** No weight limit. No breed restrictions. No pet fee. Ever.

Here's everything you need to know about staying at Kimpton with your dog.

## Kimpton's Pet Policy: The Details

| Policy | Kimpton |
|--------|---------|
| **Pet fee** | $0 (free) |
| **Weight limit** | None |
| **Breed restrictions** | None |
| **Number of pets** | No limit |
| **Pet types** | Dogs, cats, birds, fish, and more |

That's not a typo. Kimpton has **no weight limit**. They've welcomed Great Danes, Saint Bernards, and everything in between. Their unofficial motto is "if they fit through the door, they're welcome."

## What Makes Kimpton Different

Kimpton didn't just add "pet-friendly" to their website and call it a day. They built their entire brand around welcoming pets.

### No Fees, Period

Most "pet-friendly" hotels charge $50–$150 per stay. Kimpton charges nothing. Stay a week with your dog and you're saving $100+ compared to other chains.

### No Weight Limits

This is the big one. Most hotels cap pets at 50–75 lbs. If you have a German Shepherd, Lab, Golden Retriever, or any other large breed, you've probably been turned away before.

At Kimpton, your 100-lb dog is just as welcome as a 10-lb dog. No awkward conversations at check-in. No hoping they don't notice your dog is "a little over" the limit.

### No Breed Restrictions

Pit bulls, Rottweilers, Dobermans, German Shepherds — breeds that some hotels ban entirely are welcome at Kimpton. They judge dogs by behavior, not breed.

### It's Not Just Tolerance — It's Celebration

Many Kimpton properties have a **Director of Pet Relations** — yes, that's a dog with an official title. They host pet-friendly events, keep treats at the front desk, and genuinely love seeing dogs in the lobby.

The nightly wine hour? Your dog is invited.

## Pet Amenities at Kimpton

Kimpton doesn't just allow pets — they roll out the red carpet:

- **Pet beds and bowls** available on request (often in the room already)
- **Treats at check-in** at most properties
- **Pet-friendly mini bar** items at some locations
- **Local pet recommendations** — dog parks, pet stores, vet clinics
- **Dog-walking services** at select properties
- **Pet-sitting referrals** if you need a night out

Some Kimptons even have **dog-friendly restaurant patios** on property where your pup can join you for dinner.

## How to Book Kimpton Free with Points

Kimpton is part of **IHG One Rewards** (InterContinental Hotels Group). You can book free stays using IHG points.

### Earning IHG Points

**Option 1: IHG Credit Cards**

| Card | Annual Fee | Sign-Up Bonus | Best For |
|------|------------|---------------|----------|
| IHG One Rewards Traveler | $0 | 80,000 points | No-risk starting point |
| IHG One Rewards Premier | $99 | 140,000 points | Regular Kimpton stays |

The Premier card also gives you:
- **4th night free on award stays** — book 4 nights, pay for 3 with points
- **Free night certificate** every year (up to 40,000 points value)
- **Platinum Elite status** — room upgrades when available

**Option 2: Transfer from Chase Ultimate Rewards**

Chase points transfer 1:1 to IHG. If you have a Chase Sapphire Preferred or Reserve, you can move points to IHG when you find a Kimpton you want to book.

### How Many Points for a Kimpton Stay?

IHG uses dynamic pricing, so point costs vary. Typical Kimpton redemptions:

| Demand | Points per Night |
|--------|------------------|
| Off-peak | 25,000–40,000 |
| Standard | 40,000–60,000 |
| Peak | 70,000–100,000+ |

**Pro tip:** The 4th night free benefit on the IHG Premier card is huge for Kimpton stays. A 4-night trip that would cost 200,000 points becomes 150,000 — that's 25% off.

## Kimpton vs. Other Pet-Friendly Hotels

| Factor | Kimpton | Hilton | Marriott |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Pet fee | $0 | $50–$95 | $75–$150 |
| Weight limit | None | 50–75 lbs | 25–75 lbs |
| Breed restrictions | None | None (usually) | Varies |
| Number of properties | 77+ | 7,000+ | 8,000+ |
| Best for | Large dogs, avoiding fees | Most locations, points earning | Widest footprint |

**The trade-off:** Kimpton has the best pet policy, but the smallest footprint. You won't find a Kimpton in every city. For those destinations, Hilton or Marriott are solid backups.

**My approach:** Book Kimpton whenever there's one where I'm going. Use Hilton for everywhere else.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Kimpton really free for pets?

Yes. No pet fee, no deposit, no hidden charges. This has been their policy since 1992 and they've never wavered.

### What's the actual weight limit?

There isn't one. They've hosted Great Danes, Mastiffs, and Irish Wolfhounds. If your dog can walk through the door, they're welcome.

### Can I bring multiple pets?

Yes. Kimpton doesn't limit the number of pets. Traveling with 3 dogs? Still welcome, still free.

### What about cats, birds, or other pets?

Kimpton welcomes all pets — dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, fish, even monkeys (yes, really). They're not dog-specific like some "pet-friendly" hotels.

### Do I need to notify them in advance?

It's courteous to mention you're bringing a pet when booking, but it's not required. You won't be turned away for showing up with a dog.

### Can my dog be alone in the room?

Kimpton allows pets to be left in the room as long as they're comfortable and won't disturb other guests. If your dog barks when alone, consider crating them or taking them with you.

### Are there pet-friendly rooms vs. regular rooms?

No distinction. Every room at Kimpton is pet-friendly. You won't be relegated to a ground-floor smoking room from 1987.

### What if my dog damages something?

You're responsible for any damage, same as any hotel. But Kimpton doesn't require a pet deposit, which shows how confident they are in pet owners.

## The Bottom Line

If you have a large dog, a "scary" breed, or you're just tired of paying pet fees, **Kimpton is the answer**. No other major hotel chain comes close to their pet policy.

The only downside is their limited footprint — 77 hotels doesn't compete with Hilton's 7,000. But when there's a Kimpton where you're going, book it. Your dog will thank you.

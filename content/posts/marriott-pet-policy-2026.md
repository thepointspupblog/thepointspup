Marriott is the largest hotel company in the world — over 9,400 hotels across 30+ brands. The good news? Many of them welcome dogs. The tricky part? **Every property sets its own pet policy.**

Unlike Hilton (which has consistent brand-level policies) or Kimpton (which has no fees or weight limits), Marriott's pet rules vary wildly from hotel to hotel. One TownePlace Suites might allow dogs up to 100 lbs for $75, while another caps it at 50 lbs for $150.

Here's what you need to know before booking a Marriott with your dog.

## The Short Version

- **Pet fees:** $50–$250 per stay (varies by property)
- **Weight limits:** Typically 25–75 lbs (varies by property)
- **Best brands for dogs:** TownePlace Suites, Residence Inn, Element, Aloft
- **Always call ahead:** Policies vary even within the same brand

## Marriott Pet Policy by Brand

Here's a breakdown of which Marriott brands are most dog-friendly:

### Best Marriott Brands for Dog Travelers

| Brand | Pet-Friendly? | Typical Fee | Typical Weight Limit |
|-------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **TownePlace Suites** | ✅ All locations | $75–$150/stay | Up to 100 lbs |
| **Residence Inn** | ✅ All locations | $75–$150/stay | Varies (often 50+ lbs) |

## Best Marriott Brands for Large Dogs

If you have a dog over 50 lbs, focus on these brands:

**TownePlace Suites** — The most consistently dog-friendly Marriott brand. Many locations accept dogs up to **100 lbs** with reasonable fees ($75–$150). All locations are pet-friendly.

**Residence Inn** — Another solid choice for large dogs. All locations accept pets, though weight limits and fees vary. Many allow dogs 50–75 lbs.

**Element by Westin** — Extended-stay brand with pet-friendly policies at all locations. Weight limits vary, so call ahead.

If your dog is over 75 lbs, you might have better luck with [Kimpton (no weight limits, no fees)](/posts/kimpton-pet-policy-2026/) or certain [Hilton brands](/posts/hilton-pet-policy-2026/).

## How to Find Pet-Friendly Marriott Hotels

Marriott's website makes it easy to filter for pet-friendly properties:

1. Go to [Marriott.com](https://www.marriott.com)
2. Search your destination and dates
3. Click **"All Filters"**
4. Under "Amenities," select **"Pets Welcome"**
5. Click "Apply"

**Important:** Even after filtering, always call the hotel directly to confirm:
- Your dog's specific weight is allowed
- The pet fee amount
- Any breed restrictions
- Whether your room type accepts pets

## Marriott Pet Fees Explained

Unlike some chains that charge per night, most Marriott properties charge **per stay**:

- **Short stays (1–4 nights):** $50–$100 typical
- **Longer stays (5+ nights):** $100–$150 typical
- **Luxury brands:** $150–$250

The fee is **non-refundable** and covers cleaning. You'll pay it at check-in.

**Pro tip:** If you're staying a week or longer, Marriott's extended-stay brands (TownePlace, Residence Inn, Element) often offer better value than paying per-night fees at other brands.

## How to Book Marriott Free with Points

Here's the good news: You can use **Marriott Bonvoy points** to book pet-friendly stays, and you'll still just pay the pet fee in cash.

### How Many Points Do You Need?

Marriott uses dynamic pricing, but here are typical ranges:

| Property Type | Points per Night |
|---------------|------------------|
| TownePlace Suites | 15,000–25,000 |
| Residence Inn | 20,000–35,000 |
| Aloft | 15,000–30,000 |
| Courtyard | 20,000–35,000 |
| Marriott Hotels | 30,000–50,000 |

### Best Credit Card for Marriott Points

The **Marriott Bonvoy Boundless** card offers one of the best sign-up bonuses for pet travelers:

- **Sign-up bonus:** 3 free nights (worth up to 50,000 points each)
- **Annual fee:** $95
- **Earning:** 6x points at Marriott, 2x everywhere else
- **Free night:** One free night certificate each year (up to 35,000 points)

Three free nights can get you a week at a TownePlace Suites or Residence Inn — plenty of time for a dog-friendly road trip.

## Tips for Staying at Marriott with Your Dog

**Before you book:**
- Call the specific hotel to confirm pet policy
- Ask about weight limits, breed restrictions, and fees
- Request a ground-floor room near an exit
- Ask if there's a designated pet relief area

**At check-in:**
- Bring your dog's vaccination records (rarely asked, but good to have)
- Pay the pet fee (usually charged to your card at check-in)
- Ask about pet relief areas and nearby parks
- Get the front desk number in case you need anything

**During your stay:**
- Never leave your dog unattended in the room for long periods
- Keep your dog leashed in all public areas
- Use the "Do Not Disturb" sign if your dog is in the room
- Clean up after your dog promptly

## Marriott vs. Hilton vs. Kimpton for Dog Travelers

| Factor | Marriott | Hilton | Kimpton |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Consistency** | Varies by property | Brand-level policies | Same everywhere |
| **Pet fees** | $50–$250 | $50–$95 | **$0** |
| **Weight limits** | 25–100 lbs | 75 lbs typical | **No limit** |
| **Best for** | Extended stays | Most travelers | Large dogs |

**My take:** Marriott is great for extended stays (TownePlace, Residence Inn) and has an excellent sign-up bonus. But if you want consistent policies and lower fees, [Hilton](/posts/hilton-pet-policy-2026/) is usually easier. And if you have a large dog, [Kimpton](/posts/kimpton-pet-policy-2026/) is unbeatable.

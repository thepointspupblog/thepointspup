## In-Cabin Pet Policy

### What's Allowed

American allows cats and dogs in the cabin on most domestic flights and select international routes.

- **One carrier per passenger**
- **Pet must stay in carrier** under the seat for the entire flight
- **Carrier counts as carry-on** — You still get one personal item
- **Small dogs only** — Must fit completely in carrier under the seat

### Weight Limits

American doesn't have a strict weight limit but does have **carrier size limits**:

- **Max carrier size:** 19" L x 13" W x 9" H

Your pet must fit comfortably in a carrier that fits under the seat. Realistically, this means dogs under ~20 lbs, though 15-18 lbs is more comfortable.

### Carrier Requirements

- Soft-sided or hard-sided (soft-sided recommended for flexibility)
- Leak-proof
- Well-ventilated
- Pet must be able to stand and turn around
- Must stay closed during the entire flight

## In-Cabin Fees

| Route | Fee |
|-------|-----|
| Domestic US | $150 each way |
| Canada/Mexico/Caribbean | $150 each way |
| Central/South America | $200 each way |

Round-trip domestic = $300 total.

## How to Book (In-Cabin)

1. **Book your flight first** on aa.com or by phone
2. **Call American to add your pet** — 1-800-433-7300
3. **Or add at check-in** — Arrive early and inform the agent

You **cannot** add a pet online during booking. You must call or do it at the airport.

**Limit:** American restricts pets per flight. Call early to confirm space.

## Cargo: American Airlines PetEmbark

American's cargo pet program is called **PetEmbark**. It's for pets too large to fly in the cabin.

### How PetEmbark Works

- Book through American Airlines Cargo
- Your pet travels in a pressurized, temperature-controlled cargo hold
- You drop off at the American Cargo facility (separate from passenger terminal)
- Pick up at the destination cargo facility

### PetEmbark Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Crate** | IATA-compliant, hard-sided kennel |
| **Health certificate** | Within 10 days of travel from a licensed vet |
| **Age** | Pets must be at least 8 weeks old |
| **Food/water** | Dishes attached to crate door for longer flights |
| **Bedding** | Absorbent material in crate |

### PetEmbark Restrictions

| Restriction | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Snub-nosed breeds** | NOT allowed in cargo (see list below) |
| **Temperature embargoes** | No travel when temps below 45°F or above 85°F |
| **Strong breed restrictions** | Some "strong dog" breeds restricted |
| **Seasonal suspensions** | May suspend service during extreme weather |

### Breed Restrictions (Cargo)

American has **extensive breed restrictions** for cargo — more than most airlines.

**Snub-nosed breeds banned from cargo:**
- Affenpinscher
- American Bully
- Boston Terrier
- Boxer
- Brussels Griffon
- Bulldog (all types)
- Cane Corso
- Chow Chow
- Dogue de Bordeaux
- English Toy Spaniel
- Japanese Chin
- Lhasa Apso
- Mastiff (all types)
- Pekingese
- Pit Bull
- Presa Canario
- Pug
- Shar-Pei
- Shih Tzu
- Tibetan Spaniel
- And mixed breeds of the above

**Note:** American also restricts some "strong dog" breeds from cargo due to crate escape concerns. Check with American Cargo for the current list.

### PetEmbark Fees

Fees vary by:
- Route
- Crate size
- Pet weight

Expect **$200-$500** for domestic routes. International can be significantly more. Contact American Airlines Cargo for a quote.

## Tips for Flying American with Your Dog

### For In-Cabin

1. **Call early** — Pet spots fill up quickly
2. **Measure your carrier** — 19" x 13" x 9" max
3. **Choose window seats** — More under-seat space
4. **Avoid bulkhead and exit rows** — No under-seat storage
5. **Book direct flights** — Connections add stress
6. **Tire out your dog** — Exercise before the airport

### For PetEmbark Cargo

1. **Check breed restrictions first** — American's list is extensive
2. **Book direct flights only** — Minimize risk
3. **Avoid extreme weather seasons** — Embargoes are common summer and winter
4. **Use an IATA-compliant crate** — Properly sized with ventilation on all sides
5. **Don't sedate your dog** — Increases health risks at altitude
6. **Confirm multiple times** — Call American Cargo to verify everything

## TSA Process

Same as all airlines:

1. Remove your dog from the carrier
2. Carrier goes through the X-ray machine
3. Carry your dog through the metal detector
4. Put your dog back in the carrier on the other side

Keep your dog on a leash during this process in case they try to bolt.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I buy my dog a seat?

No. Pets cannot occupy seats on American Airlines. Small pets must be in a carrier under the seat. Large pets must use PetEmbark cargo.

### Can I bring two dogs?

Only if traveling with another ticketed passenger. Each passenger can bring one pet in one carrier.

### What if my dog is a snub-nosed breed but fits in a cabin carrier?

Snub-nosed breeds ARE allowed in the cabin — the restrictions only apply to cargo. If your French Bulldog fits under the seat, you can fly in-cabin.

### Are emotional support animals free?

No. American only provides accommodations for trained service dogs. Emotional support animals are treated as pets and subject to fees.

### Can I fly internationally with my dog?

In-cabin is available on some international routes. Cargo is more widely available but complex. You'll need to meet the destination country's import requirements (health certificate, microchip, vaccines, and possibly quarantine).

### What's the youngest a puppy can fly?

8 weeks old minimum, and must be weaned.

## The Bottom Line

American Airlines works well for small dogs flying in cabin. The $150 fee is standard, and the 19" x 13" x 9" carrier limit is slightly more generous than some competitors.

For larger dogs, PetEmbark cargo is available but has extensive breed restrictions — more than Delta or United. If you have a bully breed, mastiff, or other restricted type, American cargo is not an option.

For most medium and large dog owners, driving remains the practical choice.

I mentioned Amelia Island in my [beach towns roundup](/posts/best-dog-friendly-beach-towns-jacksonville), but it deserves its own post. Fernandina Beach has become my default day trip with Ansel — close enough to be spontaneous, dog-friendly enough that I never have to check policies, and charming enough that it never feels routine.

Here's everything I've learned from our many trips up A1A.

---

## The Basics

**Drive time from Jacksonville:** 45 minutes  
**Distance:** About 35 miles  
**Vibe:** Historic small town, walkable downtown, relaxed beaches

Unlike a lot of Florida beach towns that merely *tolerate* dogs, Fernandina Beach actually welcomes them. Water bowls outside shops on Centre Street. Dog menus at restaurants. A bakery where you can buy your pup a treat and yourself a craft beer. It's that kind of place.

## Beach Access: Where Dogs Can Go

Good news: leashed dogs are allowed on all city and county beaches in Fernandina Beach. This includes Main Beach, Peters Point, and most public access points along the island.

**The catch:** Dogs are NOT allowed on beaches within Florida state parks. That means no beach access at Fort Clinch State Park or Amelia Island State Park — even though dogs can use the trails at Fort Clinch.

### Best Beach Access Points

**Main Beach Park** — The most popular spot. Free parking, restrooms, outdoor showers, and a boardwalk. There's even a doggie bag dispenser. This is where I usually start.

**Peters Point Beachfront Park** — Quieter than Main Beach. Has picnic tables and a more relaxed vibe. Nassau County residents can drive onto the beach here with proof of ID.

**Seaside Park (Sadler Road)** — The only beach access where anyone can drive and park on the sand. You'll need a 4WD vehicle — I've seen trucks get stuck here more than once.

### Rules to Know

- Dogs must be leashed at all times
- You're required to carry bags and pick up waste (it's a $75 fine if you don't)
- Stay away from marked sea turtle nesting areas (roped off with orange tape)
- No alcohol on any city or county beach

## Where to Eat and Drink

Downtown Fernandina has a 50-block historic district with more dog-friendly patios than I can count. These are the spots Ansel and I keep going back to.

### The Patio at 5th and Ash

This is *the* spot. A casual American bistro with a gorgeous outdoor patio under oak trees draped in Spanish moss and string lights. Fire pits and heaters for cooler nights. Live music most evenings.

**The best part:** They have a dog menu. The owners make homemade dog biscuits. Ansel is always *very* focused here.

For humans, the Fernandina Famous Meatballs and Drunken Cheesy Bread are the moves. Happy hour (3-6pm) has half-off select appetizers.

**Address:** 416 Ash Street  
**Hours:** Mon, Wed-Sat 11am-9pm, Sun 10am-3pm (closed Tuesdays)

### Redbones Dog Bakery & Boutique

A gourmet dog bakery that also has craft beer and wine. Yes, really.

The owner is a chef who bakes all the treats in-house — you can see the oven right in the shop. They sell premium dog food, toys, and accessories too. But honestly, I'm there for the beer selection while Ansel sniffs around.

It's a legit craft beer bar that happens to also be a dog bakery. Great concept, perfectly executed.

**Address:** 809 S 8th Street

### More Dog-Friendly Patios

**Timoti's Seafood Shak** — Casual seafood spot with a shaded patio. They'll bring out dog treats without asking. Great fish tacos and clam chowder.

**Café Karibo** — Eclectic cafe with a spacious garden patio under oak trees. Good for a longer lunch.

**Sliders Seaside Grill** — Oceanfront tiki bar right at Main Beach. Perfect post-beach spot.

**PJD's Beer & Wine Garden** — Owned by local legend "Pajama Dave." Great craft beer selection, live music, very dog-friendly. Indoor and outdoor seating.

**Mocama Beer Company** — Taproom near downtown with rotating food trucks. Dogs welcome at outdoor tables.

## Beyond the Beach

### Fort Clinch State Park

One of the best state parks in Northeast Florida. Dogs are welcome on all hiking trails — there's a 6-mile multi-use trail and a shorter Willow Pond loop. Beautiful maritime hammock, shaded oak canopy.

**The catch:** Dogs cannot go on the beach or inside the historic fort. Trails only.

**Entry fee:** $6 per vehicle

### Egans Creek Greenway

A 300-acre nature preserve with a network of trails right in town. Leashed dogs welcome. Good for a morning walk before hitting a patio for lunch.

**Heads up:** There are gators in the water, so keep your dog close and on-leash.

### Nassau Humane Society Dog Park

If you want to let your dog run off-leash, this is the spot. It's actually one of the top-rated dog parks in the country — separate areas for large and small dogs, plus a swimming pool for pups.

**Location:** 671 Airport Road  
**Hours:** 9am-5pm daily (closed Tuesdays for cleaning)  
**Cost:** $5/day or $30/month

## Where to Stay (On Points)

If you want to make it a weekend, there are several dog-friendly hotels bookable on points.

**Hampton Inn & Suites Amelia Island** — Right in the historic harbor district. Welcomes two pets up to 75 lbs for a $75 fee. Bookable with Hilton Honors points.

**Home2 Suites by Hilton** — Another Hilton option, more of an extended-stay setup with kitchenettes. Pet-friendly.

**Residence Inn Amelia Island** — Marriott property, good for longer stays. Check pet policy before booking.

**Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island** — If you want to go all out. Pet-friendly, but definitely a splurge (or a lot of points).

## The Bottom Line

Fernandina Beach is the rare Florida beach town that genuinely welcomes dogs — not just tolerates them. Between the beaches, the walkable downtown, and spots like The Patio and Redbones, it's become my go-to day trip with Ansel.

If you're in Jacksonville and looking for an easy escape with your pup, this is it.

## Tips for Booking Hilton with Your Dog

### 1. Always Call the Property

Online booking shows "pet-friendly," but doesn't tell you the weight limit or fee. A 2-minute call confirms:
- Exact pet fee
- Weight limit at that location
- Any breed restrictions
- Pet relief areas on property

### 2. Request a Ground Floor Room

Ask for a room near an exit for easy potty breaks. First-floor rooms near a side door are ideal — you can slip out for late-night walks without trekking through the lobby.

### 3. Add a Note to Your Reservation

When booking online, add a note that you're traveling with a dog. Include the breed and weight. This flags your reservation so the front desk is prepared.

### 4. Bring Documentation

Keep your dog's vaccination records handy. Some properties ask for proof of rabies vaccination at check-in.

### 5. Know the Rules

Most Hilton properties require:
- Dogs must be on leash in public areas
- Dogs cannot be left unattended in rooms (or must be crated)
- You're responsible for any damage
- No dogs in pool, fitness center, or restaurant areas

## How to Book Hilton Free with Points

Pet fees are unavoidable, but the room itself can be free. I use Hilton credit cards to earn points on everyday spending, then book award nights at pet-friendly properties.

**The math:** A typical Hilton stay costs 30,000–60,000 points per night. The Hilton Surpass card has a 155,000-point sign-up bonus — enough for 2-5 free nights right out of the gate.

**My approach:**
1. Earn Hilton points from a credit card (groceries, gas, dining all count)
2. Book award nights at pet-friendly properties
3. Pay only the pet fee out of pocket

A $200/night room + $75 pet fee becomes just $75. Much easier to stomach.

## Hilton Elite Status & Pet Travel

Elite status makes traveling with a dog easier:

| Benefit | Why It Matters for Dog Owners |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Room upgrades | More space for your pup |
| Late checkout | Extra time for morning walks |
| 5th night free | 20% off longer stays |
| F&B credit (Diamond) | Offset pet fee costs |

**Gold status** comes free with the Hilton Surpass card. **Diamond status** comes free with the Hilton Aspire card — or by spending $40k/year on the Surpass.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I bring 2 dogs to Hilton?

Most Hilton properties allow up to 2 pets. The weight limit usually applies per pet (so two 50-lb dogs may be fine, but two 75-lb dogs might exceed the limit). Always confirm with the specific property.

### Are there breed restrictions at Hilton?

Hilton doesn't have corporate breed restrictions, but individual properties (especially in certain cities or states) may restrict certain breeds due to local laws or insurance requirements. Call ahead if you have a pit bull, Rottweiler, or other commonly restricted breed.

### Can I leave my dog alone in the room?

Policies vary. Some properties require dogs to be crated if left alone. Others don't allow pets to be left unattended at all. Ask at check-in to avoid problems.

### What if my dog damages the room?

You'll be charged for any damage. Most properties take a credit card on file. Be honest about damage — trying to hide it makes things worse.

### Does Hilton provide pet amenities?

Some properties offer beds, bowls, or treats. It's not guaranteed, so bring your own supplies. Canopy by Hilton is known for having treats at check-in.

## The Bottom Line

Hilton is one of the most reliable hotel chains for dog owners. Every brand accepts pets, policies are fairly consistent, and their footprint means you'll find a pet-friendly option almost anywhere.

The key is confirming details with each property before you book — weight limits and fees vary, and a quick phone call prevents surprises at check-in.

And if you're paying for hotels anyway, consider earning Hilton points through a credit card. The pet fee is a lot easier to swallow when the room is free.

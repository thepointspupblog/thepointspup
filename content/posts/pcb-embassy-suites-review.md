Last month, Ansel and I made the drive from Jacksonville to Panama City Beach for a long weekend. I'd been eyeing the Embassy Suites by Hilton Panama City Beach Resort for a while — it's pet-friendly, right across from the beach, and I had a stack of Hilton points burning a hole in my account. Here's how it went.

## The Booking

I used my **Hilton Honors American Express Surpass** points plus a free night certificate to book this stay. The only thing I actually paid out of pocket? Tipping the valet. That's it.

**Pet fees:** $75 for stays of 1-4 nights, or $125 for 5+ nights. They allow up to 2 pets, max 75 lbs each, dogs and cats only. No breed restrictions. Ansel is a 70-pound German Shorthaired Pointer/Lab mix, so he squeaked in under the limit.

**Pro tip:** If you have Hilton Diamond status, request a room upgrade when you book. I asked and got bumped to a king suite with an ocean view and a balcony. Ansel spent a solid 20 minutes every morning just watching the beach from up there.

## The Hotel: What You Need to Know

The Embassy Suites PCB is located right by Pier Park, across the street from the beach. Not beachfront, but close enough that it's a 5-minute walk to sand.

Here's the thing nobody tells you: **there's only one elevator.**

If you're traveling with a dog — especially a bigger one who needs to go out first thing in the morning — request a room close to the elevator. I didn't think to ask, and our first morning involved a very long hallway walk with an increasingly urgent pup. Lesson learned.

The room itself was spacious (it's a suite, so you get a separate living area), clean, and the balcony was a huge win. Ansel could hang out there while I got ready without feeling cooped up.

**Note:** Dogs are not allowed at the pool. If you want pool time, you'll need to plan around it (more on that below).

## Need a Break? Daycare & Grooming Options

Sometimes you want to hit the pool or grab dinner somewhere that isn't dog-friendly. Here are your options near the hotel:

- **ZOOMIES Pet Hotel** — Full daycare, boarding, and grooming. Book ahead, especially on weekends.
- **Dagny and Dexter's** — Another solid daycare option nearby.
- **PetSmart in Pier Park** — Right next door for grooming or supplies. I dropped Ansel off here for a grooming session so I could spend a few hours at the pool.

I'd recommend booking daycare in advance if you know you'll want pool time or want to explore without the dog for a day.

## Road Trip Essentials: What I Packed

A few things that made the drive with a 70-pound dog way easier:

- **Backseat cover** — I use [this seat cover](AFFILIATE_LINK) in my 4Runner. It protects the seats, gives Ansel a non-slip surface, and makes cleanup a breeze. Worth every penny.

- **Travel water bottle with bowl** — [This one](AFFILIATE_LINK) attaches right to a cup holder. Perfect for rest stops without having to dig through bags.

- **Poop bags** — I always overpack [these](AFFILIATE_LINK). You never know when you'll need them, and running out at a hotel is not the move.

## The Verdict

This was a genuinely easy trip. The hotel is well-located for a dog-friendly beach weekend, the points redemption felt like good value, and Ansel had a blast.

Would I go back? Yeah, probably. Next time I'll be smarter about requesting a room near the elevator, and I'll book daycare in advance so I can get more pool time.

## Ansel's Rating: 4/5 Paws 🐾🐾🐾🐾

**What he loved:** The balcony. The beach. All the new smells at Pier Park.

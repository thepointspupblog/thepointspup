Last month, Ansel and I made the drive from Jacksonville to Panama City Beach for a long weekend. I'd been eyeing the Embassy Suites by Hilton Panama City Beach Resort for a while — it's dog-friendly, right across from the beach, and I had a stack of Hilton points burning a hole in my account. Here's how it went.

## The Booking

I used my **Hilton Honors American Express Surpass** points plus a free night certificate to book this stay. I stayed for 5 nights — and here's a tip: when you book 4 nights with points, the 5th night is free. That's a 20% discount built right in.

The only thing I actually paid out of pocket? Tipping the valet. That's it.

**Pet fees:** $75 for stays of 1-4 nights, or $125 for 5+ nights. They allow up to 2 pets, max 75 lbs each, dogs and cats only. No breed restrictions. Ansel is a 70-pound German Shorthaired Pointer/Lab mix, so he squeaked in under the limit.

**Pro tip:** If you have Hilton Diamond status, request a room upgrade when you book. I asked and got bumped to a king suite with an ocean view and a balcony. Ansel spent a solid 20 minutes every morning just watching the beach from up there.

## The Hotel: What You Need to Know

The Embassy Suites PCB is located right by Pier Park, across the street from the beach. Not beachfront, but close enough that it's a 5-minute walk to sand. In fact, everything we did — Dog Beach, Pier Park, Margaritaville — was within walking distance of the hotel. We barely moved the car all week.

Here's the thing nobody tells you: **there's only one elevator.**

If you're traveling with a dog — especially a bigger one who needs to go out first thing in the morning — request a room close to the elevator. I didn't think to ask, and our first morning involved a very long hallway walk with an increasingly urgent pup. Lesson learned.

*Making himself at home.*

The room itself was spacious (it's a suite, so you get a separate living area), clean, and the balcony was a huge win. Ansel could hang out there while I got ready without feeling cooped up.

The hotel also has designated dog areas around the property with poop bag stations, so those early morning and late night potty breaks are easy.

**Note:** Dogs are not allowed at the pool. If you want pool time, you'll need to plan around it (more on that below).

## The Beach

The big draw here is Dog Beach — an exclusive dog beach right across from Pier Park. You can see the "Welcome to Dog Beach" sign from Margaritaville. It's a short walk from the hotel.

*The destination.*

*First time touching PCB sand.*

*That Gulf water is unreal.*

## Dog-Friendly Dining

One of the best parts of PCB is how many restaurants have dog-friendly patios — and most of them are walking distance from the hotel. We hit up Margaritaville — great views, Ansel got tons of attention, and they didn't bat an eye at a 70-pound dog under the table.

*Lunch with a view.*

*He was very well-behaved (mostly).*

## Exploring Pier Park

Pier Park is a huge outdoor shopping area right next to the hotel — literally a few minutes walk. Lots of stores, restaurants, and photo ops. Ansel found his way onto a Ron Jon surfboard.

## Road Trip Essentials: What I Packed

A few things that made the drive with a 70-pound dog way easier:

- **Backseat cover** — Protects the seats, gives Ansel a non-slip surface, and makes cleanup a breeze.
- **Travel water bottle with bowl** — Attaches right to a cup holder. Perfect for rest stops.
- **Poop bags** — I always overpack. Running out at a hotel is not the move.

## Need a Break? Daycare & Grooming Options

Sometimes you want to hit the pool or grab dinner somewhere that isn't dog-friendly. Here are your options near the hotel:

- **ZOOMIES Pet Hotel** — Full daycare, boarding, and grooming. Book ahead, especially on weekends.
- **Dagny and Dexter's** — Another solid daycare option nearby.
- **PetSmart in Pier Park** — Right next door for grooming or supplies. I dropped Ansel off here for a grooming session so I could spend a few hours at the pool.

I'd recommend booking daycare in advance if you know you'll want pool time or want to explore without the dog for a day.

## The Verdict

This was a genuinely easy trip. The hotel is well-located for a dog-friendly beach weekend, the points redemption felt like good value, and Ansel had a blast.

Would I go back? Yeah, probably. Next time I'll be smarter about requesting a room near the elevator, and I'll book daycare in advance so I can get more pool time.

## Ansel's Rating: 4/5 Paws 🐾🐾🐾🐾

**What he loved:** The balcony. The beach. All the new smells at Pier Park.

**What he didn't love:** That long hallway walk at 6am.

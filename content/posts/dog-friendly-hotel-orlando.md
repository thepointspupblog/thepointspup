A reader named Tabatha reached out after her [Pawprints submission](/page/pawprints/) about staying near Disney with her dog Oakleigh. She asked if I had recommendations for Orlando — specifically somewhere close to the parks that actually welcomes dogs without crazy restrictions.

I haven't personally stayed in Orlando with Ansel yet (it's on the list), but I spent a few hours digging into this one because it's such a common question. Orlando has over 600 pet-friendly hotels according to Booking.com — but most of them have weight limits under 50 lbs, charge $150+ in pet fees, or are so far from the parks that you'd spend half your trip in traffic.

Here's what I landed on.

## My Pick: Home2 Suites by Hilton Orlando at Flamingo Crossings

**Why this one?**

It checks all the boxes for dog travelers:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Pet fee** | $75 (1-4 nights) / $125 (5+ nights) |
| **Weight limit** | 75 lbs |
| **# of pets** | 2 dogs or cats |
| **Breed restrictions** | None |
| **Distance to Disney** | ~10 minutes |
| **Book free with** | Hilton Honors points |

This is a Home2 Suites, which is Hilton's extended-stay brand. That means every room has a full kitchen — fridge, microwave, dishwasher, the works. Super helpful when you're traveling with a dog and don't want to eat every meal at a restaurant.

## Why Not the Fancier Options?

I looked at the Loews hotels at Universal (they have a "Loews Loves Pets" program), but they charge $100-150 per stay and have a 50 lb limit at some properties. The Four Seasons at Disney is technically pet-friendly but... it's the Four Seasons. Not exactly a points redemption most of us can swing.

The Grand Bohemian downtown is beautiful but caps dogs at 40 lbs and charges $150 per stay.

Home2 Suites hits the sweet spot: reasonable pet fee, 75 lb weight limit (Ansel would fit!), and it's a Hilton property — so you can book it entirely with points.

## The Pet Policy Details

I dug into this because pet policies can be inconsistent even within the same brand:

- **75 lb weight limit** — Confirmed on Hilton's site and multiple third-party sources
- **2 pets max** — Dogs or cats
- **No breed restrictions** — At least not at the corporate level
- **Pet relief area on property** — They have a designated dog area with waste stations
- **Pets cannot be left unattended** — Standard Hilton policy

One thing I noticed in reviews: a few guests mentioned the pet relief area is on the smaller side. If you have a dog who needs more space to stretch, plan to drive 10-15 minutes to a proper dog park (more on that below).

## How to Book It Free

This is a Hilton property, so you can book it with Hilton Honors points. Rates vary by date, but expect somewhere in the 30,000-50,000 points per night range.

**The math:**

- The [Hilton Surpass card](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/#-hilton-honors-american-express-surpass) has a 155,000 point sign-up bonus
- That's 3-5 free nights at this property
- You'd only pay the $75-125 pet fee out of pocket

If you book 5 nights with points, you also get the **5th night free** — so you're really only "spending" 4 nights worth of points for a 5-night stay.

## What's Nearby for Dogs

Orlando isn't exactly a "dog destination" — you can't bring your pup into the theme parks — but there's still plenty to do:

### Dog Parks

**Dr. P. Phillips Community Park** — About 15 minutes from Flamingo Crossings. Separate areas for large and small dogs, agility equipment, water stations, and plenty of shade. This is probably your best bet for letting your dog run off-leash.

**West Orange Dog Park** — In nearby Winter Garden, about 10 minutes away. Well-maintained with separate sections by dog size.

**Lake Baldwin Park** — A bit further out (25-30 minutes) but worth the drive if you want a dog beach. Over 23 acres with an off-leash swimming area. One of the highest-rated dog parks in the Orlando area.

### Dog-Friendly Dining

**Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar** — About 10 minutes from the hotel in the Hamlin area. Yes, it's literally called Lazy Dog. They have a patio and a dog menu.

**Rock & Brews** — Also in the Hamlin/Flamingo Crossings area. Dog-friendly patio.

**Downtown Winter Garden** — About 15 minutes away. Walkable downtown area with several dog-friendly patios and a nice trail along the West Orange Trail.

## Other Options I Considered

If Home2 Suites doesn't work for your dates, here are the runners-up:

**Homewood Suites by Hilton Orlando at Flamingo Crossings** — Literally next door to the Home2, same pet policy (75 lbs, $75-125 fee). Also bookable with Hilton points. The main difference is room layout — Homewood has more traditional suite configurations.

**Holiday Inn Express & Suites Nearest Universal Orlando** — If you're more focused on Universal than Disney. IHG property, so bookable with IHG points. Pet fee is $75-125, accepts dogs of any size.

**Residence Inn Orlando at Flamingo Crossings** — Marriott property if you're in that ecosystem. Pet-friendly, but Marriott pet policies vary more by property so call ahead to confirm weight limits.

## The Bottom Line

If you're heading to Orlando with your dog and want to stay near Disney without paying cash for the room, **Home2 Suites at Flamingo Crossings** is the move. The 75 lb weight limit covers most dogs, the pet fee is reasonable, and you can book it entirely with Hilton points.

Just don't expect to bring your pup into Magic Kingdom. Plan some dog park visits, find a good patio restaurant, and enjoy the fact that you're staying for free while everyone else is paying $200+ per night.

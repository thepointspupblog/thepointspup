If you've been following along, you know I'm obsessed with Hilton for dog travel. But here's the thing: **IHG has a secret weapon that even Hilton can't match.**

It's called Kimpton.

Kimpton is hands-down the most dog-friendly hotel brand in existence. No weight limits. No breed restrictions. No pet fees. Ever. They'll welcome your Great Dane the same way they'd welcome a Chihuahua.

But Kimpton is just one piece of the IHG puzzle. Let me break down the entire IHG portfolio so you know exactly where you can (and can't) bring your dog.

## The IHG Pet-Friendly Lineup

IHG has 20 hotel brands, but not all of them welcome dogs. Here's what you need to know:

### Tier 1: The Gold Standard

**Kimpton Hotels** ⭐ THE BEST
- **Weight limit:** None ("If your pet fits through the door, we'll welcome them in")
- **Pet fee:** $0
- **Breed restrictions:** None
- **Number of pets:** Unlimited
- **Pet types:** Dogs, cats, birds, fish, even your pet lizard

Kimpton isn't just pet-friendly — they're pet-obsessed. Every property has a "Director of Pet Relations" (usually an adorable resident dog). They'll greet your pet by name, provide beds and bowls, and even give you a list of nearby dog parks and pet-friendly restaurants.

The nightly wine hour? Your dog is invited.

### Tier 2: Always Pet-Friendly (With Fees)

These brands welcome pets at ALL locations:

**Staybridge Suites**
- **Weight limit:** 50 lbs (varies by property)
- **Pet fee:** ~$75/week
- **Best for:** Extended stays with a kitchen

**Candlewood Suites**
- **Weight limit:** 80 lbs
- **Pet fee:** $75 for 1-6 nights, $150 for 7+ nights
- **Best for:** Budget-friendly extended stays

Both are extended-stay brands with full kitchens — perfect for longer trips when you want to cook for yourself (and your pup).

### Tier 3: Often Pet-Friendly (Check First)

These brands have pet-friendly properties, but policies vary by location:

**Hotel Indigo**
- **Weight limit:** 40-80 lbs (varies)
- **Pet fee:** $50-$75 per stay
- **Vibe:** Boutique, artsy, neighborhood-focused

**InterContinental**
- **Weight limit:** Varies widely
- **Pet fee:** Can be steep ($100-$250 in major cities)
- **Best for:** Luxury stays when you can find a good deal

**Crowne Plaza**
- **Weight limit:** Varies by property
- **Pet fee:** Varies
- **Note:** Not all locations are pet-friendly

**Holiday Inn / Holiday Inn Express**
- **Weight limit:** Usually 40-50 lbs
- **Pet fee:** $25-$75 per stay
- **Note:** Very hit-or-miss — always call ahead

**EVEN Hotels**
- **Weight limit:** Varies
- **Pet fee:** Varies
- **Vibe:** Wellness-focused, often in suburban areas

### Tier 4: Usually NOT Pet-Friendly

- Six Senses
- Regent
- Vignette Collection
- HUALUXE

## Why Kimpton Wins for Large Dogs

Let me be real: if you have a dog over 50 lbs, **Kimpton is your only guaranteed option in the IHG family**.

Here's why this matters:

| Brand | 70-lb Dog Allowed? |
|-------|-------------------|
| Kimpton | ✅ Yes, always |
| Candlewood Suites | ✅ Yes (under 80 lbs) |
| Staybridge Suites | ❌ No (50 lb limit) |
| Hotel Indigo | ⚠️ Maybe (check property) |
| Holiday Inn | ❌ Usually no |

Ansel weighs 70 lbs. At Kimpton, nobody blinks. At most other IHG brands, we'd be turned away.

## How to Earn IHG Points for Free Stays

Here's where it gets good. You can stay at Kimpton for free using IHG One Rewards points.

### The IHG Credit Cards

**IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card** ($99/year)
- 175,000 bonus points after $5,000 spend
- Free night certificate every year (up to 40,000 points value)
- 4th night free on award stays
- Automatic Platinum Elite status

**IHG One Rewards Traveler Credit Card** ($0/year)
- 120,000 bonus points after $2,000 spend
- No annual fee
- Silver Elite status

### Point Values

IHG points are worth about 0.5-0.6 cents each. A typical Kimpton redemption runs 30,000-60,000 points per night, though prices vary by date and location.

**Pro tip:** The 4th night free perk on the Premier card is huge. Book 4 nights and you essentially get 25% off your points redemption.

### Transfer Partners

You can also transfer points to IHG from:
- Chase Ultimate Rewards (1:1)
- Bilt Rewards (1:1)

But honestly? IHG points aren't the best use of Chase points. I'd rather transfer to Hyatt. The IHG credit card bonuses are usually the better path.

## Kimpton vs. Hilton: Which Is Better for Dogs?

I get this question a lot. Here's my honest take:

| Factor | Kimpton | Hilton |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Pet fees | $0 | $0-$75 (varies) |
| Weight limits | None | None (most brands) |
| Number of properties | ~70 | 7,000+ |
| Loyalty program | IHG One Rewards | Hilton Honors |
| Point value | ~0.5¢ | ~0.5¢ |
| Best for | Boutique experience, guaranteed pet-friendly | More locations, easier to find availability |

**My verdict:** Kimpton is *technically* more dog-friendly, but Hilton's massive footprint makes it more practical for everyday travel. I use both.

If there's a Kimpton where I'm going? I book it. If not? Hilton it is.

## Tips for Booking Pet-Friendly IHG Stays

1. **Always call the property directly** — Even "dog-friendly" hotels can have restrictions that aren't listed online.

2. **Book Kimpton for guaranteed acceptance** — Don't risk showing up with your 70-lb dog only to be told there's a 50-lb limit.

3. **Use the IHG app filter** — Search for "Pet Friendly" under amenities, but verify the specific policy.

4. **Stack promotions** — IHG frequently runs double/triple point promotions. Combine with credit card bonuses for maximum value.

5. **Consider extended-stay brands** — Candlewood and Staybridge have kitchens, which is clutch for longer trips with dogs (no restaurant hunting!).

## The Bottom Line

If you're traveling with a large dog and want zero stress about pet policies, **Kimpton is unbeatable**. No weight limits, no fees, no judgment.

The trade-off? There are only about 70 Kimpton properties, mostly in major cities. You won't find one in every small town.

For broader coverage, pair your IHG strategy with Hilton. Between the two programs, you'll have pet-friendly options almost anywhere.

**My recommendation:**
- Get the IHG Premier card for Kimpton stays ($99/year, free night certificate pays for itself)
- Get the Hilton Surpass or Aspire for everywhere else
- Never pay pet fees again

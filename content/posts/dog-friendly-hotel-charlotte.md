Charlotte doesn't get enough love from dog travelers. Most people just pass through on I-85, maybe stop for a Panthers game, and keep driving. But the Queen City has become one of the most dog-friendly cities in the Southeast — and it has what I look for in every destination: a great hotel you can book free with points.

Here's everything you need to know about visiting Charlotte with your dog.

## My Pick: Kimpton Tryon Park Hotel

**Why this one?**

This is the no-brainer choice for dog travelers:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Pet fee** | None |
| **Weight limit** | None ("if it fits in the elevator") |
| **# of pets** | No limit |
| **Breed restrictions** | None |
| **Location** | Uptown Charlotte, 3rd Ward |
| **Book free with** | IHG One Rewards points |

Kimpton's pet policy is the gold standard in the hotel industry. No fee, no weight limit, no breed restrictions. They'll even provide pet beds, bowls, and treats at check-in. Ansel at 70 lbs? No problem. Your 120 lb Great Dane? Also welcome.

The hotel is right across from Romare Bearden Park — a 5.4-acre green space in the middle of Uptown that's perfect for morning walks. You're also within walking distance of Bank of America Stadium (Panthers), Truist Field (Knights baseball), and the Spectrum Center (Hornets).

## The Pet Policy Details

Kimpton is one of the few hotel brands that genuinely loves pets:

- **No weight limit** — If your dog fits in the elevator, they're welcome
- **No breed restrictions** — None at the corporate level
- **No pet fee** — $0
- **Pet amenities provided** — Beds, bowls, treats, and waste bags
- **Pets can be left unattended** — If you notify the front desk
- **Nightly wine hour** — Dogs are welcome to join

They even partner with Wag! for dog walking services if you need someone to take your pup out while you're at a meeting or event.

## How to Book It Free

Kimpton is part of IHG, so you can book with IHG One Rewards points. Charlotte typically runs 40,000-60,000 points per night depending on the date.

**The math:**

- The [IHG One Rewards Premier card](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/) has an 140,000 point sign-up bonus
- That's 2-3 free nights at this property
- You'd pay $0 in pet fees

If you're comparing to cash rates (usually $200-300/night), you're getting solid value — especially since you're also avoiding the $75-150 pet fees that other Charlotte hotels charge.

## Dog Daycare While You Explore

Charlotte has a ton going on — breweries, sports, museums, the NASCAR Hall of Fame. Not all of it is dog-friendly, so you might need somewhere for your pup to hang out for a few hours.

### Skiptown (South End)

This is the spot. Skiptown is a 24,000 square foot facility that combines dog daycare, boarding, grooming, and a full bar with 25 taps. Yes, you can drop your dog off for daycare, grab a beer, and watch them play through the windows.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Address** | 222 Rampart St, Charlotte, NC 28203 |
| **Distance from Kimpton** | ~10 minutes by car, 20 by Light Rail |
| **Hours** | Daycare: 7am-7pm daily |
| **Bar & Park Hours** | Mon-Fri 1pm-9pm, Sat-Sun 11am-9pm |
| **Reservations** | Required — download the Skiptown app |

The facility has indoor and outdoor play areas, an agility course, and splash pads. They separate dogs by size and temperament. You'll get photo updates throughout the day through their app.

**Requirements:** Dogs must be spayed/neutered (if over 6 months), up to date on Rabies, DHPP, and Bordetella. All dogs need to complete a "compatibility day" before their first regular daycare visit.

**Pro tip:** If you just want to hang out at the bar with your dog (not daycare), you can buy a day pass to use the off-leash park area while you grab drinks.

### Club Fetch (South End)

Another solid option, especially if Skiptown is booked. Club Fetch is in the heart of historic South End and offers daycare, boarding, and grooming.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Address** | 2426 Dunavant St, Charlotte, NC 28203 |
| **Hours** | Mon-Fri 7am-7pm, Sat-Sun 9am-6pm |
| **Phone** | (980) 243-3046 |

They have spacious play areas, HD cameras throughout the facility, and custom-designed boarding suites with 50" TVs for evening movies (yes, really). Dogs must pass an evaluation on their first day.

### Other Options

**Carolina Doggie Playland** (3111 S Tryon St) — One of Charlotte's oldest daycares, open since 2004. Family-owned, with bubble dance parties, pools, and splash pads. Daycare runs ~$36/day, with package discounts available.

**Lucky Dog Bark & Brew** (multiple locations) — Similar concept to Skiptown: daycare + dog bar. They offer a rotating break/play schedule (90 minutes play, 90 minutes rest) which is great for high-energy dogs. Drop-ins welcome, no reservations required.

**Molly's Dog Care** (South End, 1115 S Mint St) — Newer facility that opened in 2025. Offers daycare, boarding, grooming, and training. Live feed video available so you can check in on your pup.

## Dog Parks

If you'd rather let your dog run free without the daycare cost, Charlotte has several solid off-leash options:

### Frazier Park Dog Park

The most popular dog park in Charlotte proper. It's in the Wesley Heights neighborhood, about 10 minutes from the Kimpton.

- **Address:** 1201 W Trade St, Charlotte, NC 28202
- **Features:** Separate areas for large and small dogs, water fountains, benches, shade structures
- **Hours:** Dawn to dusk

### Davie Dog Park

A bit further out in the Davie neighborhood, but worth the drive for more space. Less crowded than Frazier, especially on weekday mornings.

- **Address:** 1401 S Church St, Charlotte, NC 28203
- **Features:** Large open areas, double-gated entry, waste stations

### Barkingham Park (Dog Bar + Park)

Part bar, part dog park. Your dog can play off-leash while you grab a drink. It's in NoDa (North Davidson), about 15 minutes from Uptown.

## Dog-Friendly Breweries

Charlotte has become a legitimate craft beer destination, and most breweries welcome dogs on their patios. Here are the best ones:

### Sycamore Brewing (South End)

One of Charlotte's most popular breweries, with a huge outdoor space and food trucks on weekends. Dogs are welcome throughout the patio area.

- **Address:** 2161 Hawkins St, Charlotte, NC 28203
- **Vibe:** Lively, crowded on weekends, great people-watching

### NoDa Brewing Company

The OG Charlotte craft brewery. They've got a spacious taproom and outdoor area where dogs are welcome.

- **Address:** 2921 N Tryon St, Charlotte, NC 28206
- **Try:** Hop Drop 'n Roll IPA (their flagship)

### Birdsong Brewing Company

Another NoDa favorite with a laid-back vibe and dog-friendly patio.

- **Address:** 1016 N Davidson St, Charlotte, NC 28206

### Triple C Brewing Company (South End)

Great outdoor space with picnic tables and a relaxed atmosphere. Food trucks rotate through regularly.

### Charlotte Beer Garden

This place is massive — 360+ beers on tap spread across multiple levels. Dogs are welcome on the outdoor patios.

- **Address:** 1300 S Tryon St, Charlotte, NC 28203

## Dog-Friendly Restaurants & Bars

### The Dog Bar (NoDa)

Yes, it's literally called The Dog Bar. This is a fully off-leash bar where your dog can roam free while you drink. There's a $10 one-time membership fee, and all dogs must be spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations.

- **Address:** 3307 N Davidson St, Charlotte, NC 28205
- **Hours:** Daily, varies by season

### Lucky Dog Bark & Brew

I mentioned these guys for daycare, but they're also a legit bar. Multiple locations around Charlotte with indoor/outdoor dog parks and full bar service. Great for a casual afternoon.

### Seoul Food Meat Co.

A Korean BBQ restaurant with a twist: they have a fenced-in dog park on the patio. So you can eat brisket while your dog runs around. Only in Charlotte.

- **Address:** 1400 S Church St, Charlotte, NC 28203

### Angry Ale's (Montford)

A neighborhood bar with a dog-friendly patio and solid pub food. Good spot for watching sports with your pup.

- **Address:** 1518 Montford Dr, Charlotte, NC 28209

## What Else to Do

### U.S. National Whitewater Center

About 20 minutes from Uptown, the USNWC is a 1,300-acre outdoor recreation facility with hiking trails, mountain biking, and yes — dogs are welcome on most trails (leashed). It's one of the best outdoor spots in the Charlotte area.

### Walk the Rail Trail

The Charlotte Rail Trail is a 3.5-mile urban trail that runs through South End, connecting breweries, restaurants, and shops. It's paved and dog-friendly — perfect for a morning walk before brunch.

### Romare Bearden Park

Right across from the Kimpton. Great for quick walks and has nice views of the Uptown skyline. Not off-leash, but a pleasant green space in the middle of the city.

---

## Other Hotels I Considered

If Kimpton Tryon Park doesn't work for your dates:

**Aloft Charlotte Uptown at the EpiCentre** — Marriott brand, accepts pets up to 40 lbs, $100 pet fee. Bookable with Marriott Bonvoy points.

**Home2 Suites by Hilton Charlotte Uptown** — Hilton extended-stay brand with kitchens. Pet fee around $75-125, 75 lb limit. Bookable with Hilton Honors points.

**The Ivey's Hotel** — Boutique property in Uptown. Pet-friendly but has weight limits and fees. Nice if you want something more upscale.

But honestly? The Kimpton is the clear winner. No fee, no weight limit, great location. It's not even close.

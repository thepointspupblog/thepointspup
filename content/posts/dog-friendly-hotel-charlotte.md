Charlotte is one of the most dog-friendly cities in the Southeast. The brewery scene alone would be worth the trip — and almost every taproom in town welcomes dogs on the patio (or inside). Add in off-leash dog bars, a massive outdoor adventure center, and some seriously good food, and you've got a perfect weekend trip with your pup.

The only question: where to stay?

After researching every pet-friendly hotel in Charlotte, one stands out above the rest.

## The Pick: Kimpton Tryon Park Hotel

**Pet fee:** None  
**Weight limit:** None  
**Book free with:** IHG One Rewards points

The Kimpton Tryon Park Hotel is the best dog-friendly hotel in Charlotte, and it's not close.

Here's why:

### No Pet Fee, No Weight Limit

Kimpton's pet policy is famously generous: if your pet fits in the elevator, they're welcome. No extra charge. No size restrictions. No breed restrictions. Dogs, cats, and "other beloved pets" are all allowed.

When you check in, they'll have a door hanger to alert housekeeping that a pet is in the room. You can request a pet bed, and they'll point you to the nearest relief area (Romare Bearden Park is literally across the street).

### Prime Location in Uptown

The hotel sits in Charlotte's 3rd Ward, steps from:

- **Romare Bearden Park** — right across the street, perfect for morning walks
- **Bank of America Stadium** (Panthers)
- **Truist Field** (Charlotte Knights minor league baseball — they do "Bark in the Ballpark" nights)
- **Spectrum Center** (Hornets)
- The **South End** brewery and restaurant scene (short walk or ride on the LYNX light rail)

You can park in nearby surface lots for around $20-25/day (cheaper than the hotel's $51 valet), or find free street parking after 6pm on weekends.

### IHG Points = Free Nights

The Kimpton Tryon Park is part of IHG One Rewards, which means you can book award nights with IHG points.

Kimpton properties typically run 40,000-70,000 points per night depending on demand. For Charlotte, expect to pay somewhere in the 50,000-60,000 range on most weekends.

**How to get IHG points:**
- Sign up for the **IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card** — the welcome bonus alone is often enough for 2-3 free nights
- Transfer points from Chase Ultimate Rewards (not the best value, but works in a pinch)
- Earn 10x points per dollar on paid stays at IHG properties

Even if you're paying cash, rates are often $180-250/night — competitive for a boutique hotel in Uptown, especially when there's no pet fee on top.

## What to Do in Charlotte With Your Dog

Charlotte is ridiculously dog-friendly. You won't run out of things to do.

### Dog Parks & Outdoor Adventures

**U.S. National Whitewater Center**  
This 400-acre outdoor adventure complex has an off-leash dog park, miles of hiking trails, and multiple dog-friendly restaurants on-site. Leashed dogs are allowed on trails, kayaks, and stand-up paddle boards. (They can't join you on the zip line, though.)

**Skiptown Dog Bar & Park**  
A 24,000 square foot indoor/outdoor dog park in South End with a full bar serving 25 taps — including bone broth "beer" for dogs. Your pup can splash around in the water features while you grab a drink.

**Frazier Dog Park**  
Fenced areas for both large and small dogs, plus adjacent playgrounds and walking trails if you've got kids in tow.

**Davie Dog Park at William R. Davie District Park**  
Five acres of fenced, off-leash space.

### Dog-Friendly Breweries

Charlotte's brewery scene is exceptional, and almost every spot welcomes dogs:

- **Sycamore Brewing** — Large patio right on the Rail Trail in South End
- **Birdsong Brewing Co.** — Shaded outdoor area with fans, free peanuts
- **NoDa Brewing Company** — Dogs welcome on the covered patio; live music, trivia, food trucks
- **Triple C Brewing** — Patio with grassy area, rotating food trucks
- **Charlotte Beer Garden** — Claims the "largest draft beer selection in the world" (400+ taps); dog-friendly ground floor patio
- **Hi-Wire Brewing** — Dogs allowed inside the taproom

### Dog-Friendly Restaurants & Bars

**The Dog Bar (NoDa)**  
Charlotte's only fully dog-friendly bar — dogs can roam off-leash inside and out. No food served, but you can bring in takeout from nearby restaurants. Membership required ($10 one-time fee).

**Lucky Dog Bark & Brew**  
Three locations around Charlotte. Indoor/outdoor off-leash play yards plus a full bar. They do "$20 Beer & Bath Night" on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

**Seoul Food Meat Co.**  
Korean BBQ with a fenced-in dog park at both locations. Yes, your dog has their own play area while you eat Korean fried chicken.

**Angry Ale's (Montford)**  
Expansive outdoor patio with a dedicated dog menu featuring a "pup-burger" and bacon.

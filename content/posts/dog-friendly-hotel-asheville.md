Asheville is basically built for dog travelers. The brewery scene is massive and almost universally dog-friendly. The hiking is incredible. The culture is laid-back and welcoming. And there's a Kimpton right downtown.

Here's everything you need to know about visiting Asheville with your dog.

## My Pick: Kimpton Hotel Arras

**Why this one?**

The best pet policy in Asheville, hands down:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Pet fee** | None |
| **Weight limit** | None |
| **# of pets** | No limit |
| **Breed restrictions** | None |
| **Location** | Downtown Asheville |
| **Book free with** | IHG One Rewards points |

Kimpton's pet policy is unmatched. No fee, no weight limit, no breed restrictions. They provide pet beds, bowls, and treats at check-in. The downtown location puts you walking distance from dozens of breweries, restaurants, and shops.

---

## The Pet Policy Details

Kimpton genuinely loves pets:

- **No weight limit** — If your dog fits in the elevator, they're welcome
- **No breed restrictions** — None at the corporate level
- **No pet fee** — $0
- **Pet amenities provided** — Beds, bowls, treats, and waste bags
- **Pets can be left unattended** — If you notify the front desk
- **Nightly wine hour** — Dogs are welcome to join

---

## How to Book It Free

Kimpton is part of IHG, so you book with IHG One Rewards points. Asheville typically runs 40,000-60,000 points per night, spiking during leaf season (October) and summer weekends.

**The math:**

- The [IHG One Rewards Premier card](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/) has a 175,000 point sign-up bonus
- That's 3-4 free nights at this property
- You'd pay $0 in pet fees

Cash rates run $250-400/night depending on season, so points deliver strong value.

Austin might be the most dog-friendly city in America. It's not even close. Between the off-leash parks, the dog-friendly patios (basically everywhere), the swimming holes, and a culture that genuinely embraces dogs, it's a must-visit for anyone who travels with their pup.

And yes — there's a Kimpton. Here's everything you need to know.

## My Pick: Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt

**Why this one?**

The Rainey Street location and Kimpton's legendary pet policy make this an easy choice:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Pet fee** | None |
| **Weight limit** | None |
| **# of pets** | No limit |
| **Breed restrictions** | None |
| **Location** | Rainey Street District |
| **Book free with** | IHG One Rewards points |

No fee, no weight limit, no breed restrictions. They provide pet beds, bowls, and treats at check-in. The location on Rainey Street puts you in one of Austin's most vibrant (and dog-friendly) neighborhoods.

Rainey Street is a collection of converted bungalows that are now bars and restaurants — almost all with patios, almost all dog-friendly. You can walk out of the hotel and have a dozen options within minutes.

## The Pet Policy Details

Kimpton genuinely loves pets:

- **No weight limit** — If your dog fits in the elevator, they're welcome
- **No breed restrictions** — None at the corporate level
- **No pet fee** — $0
- **Pet amenities provided** — Beds, bowls, treats, and waste bags
- **Pets can be left unattended** — If you notify the front desk
- **Nightly wine hour** — Dogs are welcome to join (Geraldine's, the hotel restaurant, has a great patio)

---

## How to Book It Free

Kimpton is part of IHG, so you book with IHG One Rewards points. Austin typically runs 50,000-70,000 points per night, though it can spike during SXSW, ACL, and other events.

**The math:**

- The [IHG One Rewards Premier card](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/) has a 175,000 point sign-up bonus
- That's 2-3 free nights at this property
- You'd pay $0 in pet fees

Cash rates run $250-450/night depending on events, so points deliver strong value.

## Other Hotels I Considered

If Kimpton Van Zandt doesn't work for your dates:

**Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt** is the only Kimpton in Austin proper, but there are other options:

**Canopy by Hilton Austin Downtown** — Hilton's boutique brand, known for being pet-friendly. ~$50-75 pet fee, 75 lb limit.

**W Austin** — Marriott property downtown. Accepts dogs up to 40 lbs with a $100+ fee.

**Hyatt Regency Austin** — On Lady Bird Lake. Pet-friendly but has weight limits and fees.

**Home2 Suites Austin** — Hilton extended-stay with kitchens. 75 lb limit, ~$75 pet fee.

**Aloft Austin** — Marriott brand known for being pet-friendly. Usually no pet fee but has weight limits at some locations.

The Kimpton remains the best choice for large dogs or multiple pets.

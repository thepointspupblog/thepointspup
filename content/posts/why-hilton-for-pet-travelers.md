When I started traveling with Ansel, my 70-pound GSP/Lab mix, I quickly learned that not all hotel chains are created equal. Some properties say they're "pet-friendly" but hit you with breed restrictions, weight limits, or fees that make you feel like your dog isn't actually welcome.

Hilton is different. Here's why it's become my go-to for dog travel.

## Every Hilton Brand Welcomes Dogs

This is the big one. Whether you're staying at a Hampton Inn on a road trip or splurging on a Waldorf Astoria for a special occasion, **every Hilton brand in the U.S. accepts pets**.

That consistency matters when you're planning trips with a dog. No more calling ahead to individual properties hoping they'll say yes. No more getting turned away at check-in because someone didn't update the website.

The brands include:

- Hampton Inn & Suites
- Hilton Garden Inn
- Home2 Suites
- Homewood Suites
- DoubleTree
- Embassy Suites
- Hilton Hotels & Resorts
- Canopy by Hilton
- Curio Collection
- Tapestry Collection
- Conrad Hotels
- Waldorf Astoria

**One caveat:** Weight limits vary by property, typically ranging from 50-75 lbs. If you have a larger dog, always call ahead to confirm. Check out my [guide to traveling with large dogs](/posts/traveling-with-large-dogs-hotel-policies/) for more tips.

## Points Are Easy to Earn

Hilton points are some of the easiest hotel points to stack through everyday spending. With the right credit card, you can earn points on:

- Groceries (including all that dog food)
- Gas stations (road trip fuel-ups)
- Restaurants (dog-friendly patios count!)
- Vet bills and pet supplies
- Everything else

I've booked multiple free nights at pet-friendly Hiltons without setting foot in a hotel — just from everyday spending on my Hilton credit card.

## Diamond Status Makes Dog Travel Easier

Hilton's top-tier status, Diamond, comes with perks that are especially valuable when you're traveling with a dog:

**Room upgrades** — More space means more room for your pup to spread out. I've been upgraded to suites multiple times, and the extra square footage makes a huge difference with a 70-pound dog.

**Late checkout** — Morning potty breaks, packing up dog gear, loading the car... it all takes longer with a pet. Late checkout (often until 2pm) gives you breathing room.

**Daily food & beverage credit** — Pet fees add up. Having your meals partially covered helps offset those costs.

**Executive lounge access** — A quiet spot to grab coffee or a snack, away from the chaos of the main lobby.

The best part? You don't have to stay 60 nights a year to get Diamond. The [Hilton Aspire card](/posts/hilton-diamond-status-guide/) gives you automatic Diamond status just for having the card.

## Pet Fees Are Reasonable

Hilton pet fees typically range from $50-$95 per stay, depending on the brand and location. That's middle-of-the-road for the industry — not the cheapest, but far from the worst offenders.

When you're booking on points, the pet fee is often your only out-of-pocket cost. I'll happily pay $75 for a "free" hotel stay at a property I know will welcome my dog without hassle.

## My Hilton Dog Travel Stack

Here's the setup I use for earning and booking dog-friendly Hilton stays:

1. **Hilton Aspire Card** — Automatic Diamond status, annual free night certificate, $400 resort credit
2. **Hilton Points** — Earned from everyday spending, used for free nights
3. **5th Night Free** — Book 4 nights on points, get the 5th free (20% savings!)
4. **BringFido** — For double-checking pet policies and weight limits at specific properties

This combo has gotten me free stays at dog-friendly Embassy Suites, Hilton Garden Inns, and more — with Ansel welcome at every single one.

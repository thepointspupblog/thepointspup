## In-Cabin Pet Policy

### What's Allowed

Delta allows small dogs, cats, and household birds in the cabin on most domestic flights and some international routes.

- **One carrier per passenger**
- **Two pets allowed per carrier** if they're the same species, small enough, and combined weight stays under the limit
- **Carrier must fit under the seat** in front of you
- **Pet must stay in carrier** for the entire flight

### Weight Limits

- **Combined weight of pet + carrier:** Under 20 lbs
- Realistically, this means dogs under ~15 lbs

Delta agents may weigh your pet and carrier at check-in. If you're over, you won't board.

### Carrier Requirements

- Soft or hard-sided
- Leak-proof bottom
- Must fit under seat (dimensions vary by aircraft)
- Pet must be able to stand and turn around
- Must stay closed during flight

**Recommended dimensions:** Keep it under 18" x 11" x 11" to fit most aircraft.

## In-Cabin Fees

| Route Type | Fee |
|------------|-----|
| Domestic US | $150 each way |
| Canada/Mexico/Caribbean/Central America | $150 each way |
| South America | $200 each way |
| International (where allowed) | $200 each way |

Fees are per carrier, each direction. Round-trip domestic = $300.

## How to Book (In-Cabin)

1. **Book your flight online first**
2. **Call Delta to add your pet** — 1-800-221-1212
3. **Or add at check-in** — Arrive early

You cannot add a pet online. You must call or do it at the airport.

**Limit:** Delta restricts the number of pets per cabin (varies by aircraft). Call early to secure a spot.

## Cargo: Delta Cargo Live Animals

If your dog is too large for the cabin, Delta offers cargo transport through **Delta Cargo**. This is a completely separate process from booking a passenger flight.

### How Cargo Works

- You book through Delta Cargo (not regular Delta reservations)
- Your dog flies in the climate-controlled cargo hold
- You drop off at the cargo facility (not the regular terminal)
- You pick up at the destination cargo facility

### Cargo Restrictions

**This is where it gets complicated:**

| Restriction | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Snub-nosed breeds** | NOT allowed in cargo (Bulldogs, Pugs, Boston Terriers, Boxers, etc.) |
| **Temperature embargoes** | No travel when temps are below 45°F or above 85°F at origin, destination, or connection |
| **Connection limits** | Direct flights preferred; connections add risk and complexity |
| **Crate requirements** | IATA-compliant, airline-approved kennel required |
| **Health certificate** | Required within 10 days of travel |

### Cargo Fees

Cargo fees vary significantly based on:

- Route
- Size/weight of pet + crate
- Season

Expect **$200-$500** for domestic routes, potentially **$1,000+** for international. Get a quote from Delta Cargo directly.

### Seasonal Embargoes

Delta suspends cargo pet transport during extreme weather. This typically affects:

- **Summer:** June-September for many routes
- **Winter:** December-February for northern routes
- **Specific days:** When forecast temps exceed limits

Check Delta Cargo's current embargoes before booking.

## Breed Restrictions

### In-Cabin

Delta allows all breeds in the cabin, including snub-nosed breeds. As long as your dog fits in a carrier under the seat, breed doesn't matter.

### Cargo

**Snub-nosed (brachycephalic) breeds are banned from cargo.** These breeds have higher risk of respiratory distress in the cargo hold. Banned breeds include:

- Bulldogs (all types)
- Pugs
- Boston Terriers
- Boxers
- Shih Tzus
- Pekingese
- Affenpinschers
- And others

If you have a snub-nosed breed that's too big for the cabin, Delta is not an option.

## Tips for Flying Delta with Your Dog

### For In-Cabin

1. **Call early** — Pet spots are limited
2. **Choose window seats** — More floor space for the carrier
3. **Avoid bulkhead and exit rows** — No under-seat storage
4. **Book direct flights** — Less stress, less risk
5. **Tire your dog out** — Exercise before the airport

### For Cargo

1. **Book direct flights only** — Connections increase risk significantly
2. **Avoid summer and winter extremes** — Embargoes are common
3. **Use a high-quality crate** — IATA-compliant, with absorbent bedding
4. **Attach food and water dishes** — Required for longer flights
5. **Don't sedate your dog** — Sedation increases health risks at altitude
6. **Confirm, confirm, confirm** — Call Delta Cargo repeatedly before travel

## TSA Process

Same as other airlines:

1. Remove dog from carrier
2. Carrier goes through X-ray
3. Carry your dog through the metal detector
4. Put dog back in carrier immediately

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I buy my dog a seat on Delta?

No. Pets cannot occupy seats. Small pets must be in a carrier under the seat. Large pets must fly cargo.

### Can I bring two dogs?

If flying in-cabin: two small dogs can share one carrier if they're small enough and combined weight (with carrier) stays under 20 lbs. Otherwise, you need two passengers.

For cargo: each dog needs its own crate and booking.

### How do I know if my dog is too big for the cabin?

If your dog is over ~15 lbs, it's borderline. Try putting your dog in the carrier at home, then see if the carrier fits under a standard seat (about 18" wide, 11" tall, 14" deep). If it's a squeeze, cargo might be your only option.

### Are emotional support animals free?

No. Delta only accommodates trained service dogs for free. Emotional support animals are treated as pets and subject to fees and restrictions.

### What about international flights?

In-cabin pets are allowed on some (not all) international routes. Cargo is more widely available but complex. You'll also need to navigate import requirements for your destination country.

## The Bottom Line

Delta works well for small dogs flying in-cabin. The $150 fee is standard, and the process is straightforward.

For larger dogs, cargo exists but comes with serious limitations — breed restrictions, temperature embargoes, and higher costs. If you have a medium or large dog, driving is often the better choice.

You're traveling with your dog and want to grab dinner at a restaurant that doesn't allow pets. Or hit the hotel pool. Or just run to the grocery store without a 70-lb shadow.

Can you leave your dog alone in the hotel room?

The answer: it depends on the hotel. Some chains are fine with it. Others will ask you to leave if they find out. And even when it's allowed, there's a right way to do it.

Here's what you need to know.

## Hotel Policies: Who Allows It, Who Doesn't

Every hotel chain handles this differently. Some have clear policies. Others leave it up to individual properties. Always confirm when you book.

### Hotels That Generally Allow Dogs to Be Left Alone

**Kimpton (IHG)**
Yes, you can leave your dog unattended. They ask that you put up the "Do Not Disturb" sign and leave a contact number with the front desk. If your dog causes a noise complaint, you may be charged a fee — but they won't kick you out for leaving your pup alone.

**Hilton Brands (most properties)**
Most Hilton properties allow dogs to be left alone in the room, but policies vary by location. Some require the dog to be crated. Always confirm with the specific hotel.

**La Quinta (Wyndham)**
Generally allows pets to be left unattended, but housekeeping won't service your room unless you're present or the pet is crated.

**Best Western**
Policies vary by property. Many allow it, some don't. Call ahead.

**Residence Inn / Extended Stay (Marriott)**
Usually allowed, often with a crate requirement. Good option for longer stays.

**Red Roof Inn**
Allows one pet per room with no fee. Policies on leaving pets alone vary — check with the property.

**Motel 6**
Generally pet-friendly and flexible about leaving dogs alone. No pet fee.

### Hotels That Do NOT Allow Dogs to Be Left Alone

**Thompson Hotels (Hyatt)**
Dogs cannot be left unattended in the room. This is clearly stated in their pet policy. Plan accordingly.

**Some Hyatt Properties**
Varies by brand and location. Thompson is a firm no; others may allow it. Always ask.

**Many Boutique Hotels**
Smaller properties often have stricter policies. Don't assume.

### The Gray Area

Many hotels technically have a "no unattended pets" policy but don't strictly enforce it — especially if your dog is quiet and you're only gone briefly. You'll often hear front desk staff say something like: "Officially we can't allow it, but if you put up the Do Not Disturb sign and your dog doesn't bark..."

That said, if your dog causes a problem while you're out, you could be asked to leave or charged extra fees. It's a risk.

## Questions to Ask When Booking

Don't assume. Call the hotel directly and ask:

1. **"Can I leave my dog alone in the room?"** — Get a clear yes or no.

2. **"Does my dog need to be crated?"** — Some hotels require it; others just recommend it.

3. **"What happens if my dog barks while I'm out?"** — Know the consequences upfront.

4. **"Will housekeeping enter if my dog is in the room?"** — Most won't. Ask about their policy.

5. **"Is there a time limit?"** — Some hotels are fine with a couple hours but not all day.

Write down who you spoke with and when. If there's any issue at check-in, you'll have a reference.

## How to Prepare Your Dog

Leaving your dog alone in an unfamiliar room is different from leaving them at home. Here's how to set them up for success:

### Before the Trip

**Practice at home.** If your dog isn't used to being alone, start practicing before your trip. Leave them in a room with the door closed for increasing amounts of time.

**Tire them out.** A tired dog is a calm dog. Plan a long walk or play session before you leave.

**Bring familiar items.** Their bed, a blanket that smells like home, their favorite toy. Familiar scents reduce anxiety.

### At the Hotel

**Do a test run first.** Before leaving for hours, step out for 10-15 minutes. Listen at the door. If your dog is barking or whining, you have a problem to solve before you leave for longer.

**Leave the TV or radio on.** Background noise masks unfamiliar hotel sounds (doors closing, people in the hallway) that might trigger barking.

**Use the Do Not Disturb sign.** This prevents housekeeping from accidentally opening the door. Essential.

**Leave a contact number with the front desk.** If there's a problem, you want them to call you — not just show up at your room.

**Keep the room cool.** Don't turn off the AC. Hotels can get warm, especially with blackout curtains.

**Remove hazards.** Check for anything your dog could get into: mini bar items on low shelves, loose cords, hotel toiletries, trash cans with food wrappers.

**Consider a crate.** Even if the hotel doesn't require it, a crate can help your dog feel secure and prevents any damage to the room.

## What If Your Dog Barks?

This is the biggest risk. A barking dog can lead to noise complaints, which can lead to:

- A warning from the front desk
- Extra fees
- Being asked to leave (rare, but it happens)

### Signs Your Dog Might Bark

- History of separation anxiety
- Barks at home when you leave
- Reactive to noises (doorbells, people walking by)
- First time staying in a hotel

### How to Prevent It

**Exercise first.** Seriously. A well-exercised dog is much more likely to sleep.

**Bring a Kong or puzzle toy.** Stuff it with peanut butter or treats. Gives them something to focus on when you leave.

**Use calming aids.** Some dogs do well with:
- Adaptil pheromone spray or collar
- Calming treats (with ingredients like L-theanine or chamomile)
- A ThunderShirt or anxiety wrap
- CBD treats (talk to your vet first)

**White noise or TV.** Masks hallway sounds that trigger barking.

**Don't make a big deal of leaving.** Slip out calmly. Long goodbyes can increase anxiety.

### If It Happens Anyway

If you get a call from the front desk about barking:

1. **Return immediately.** Don't push your luck.
2. **Apologize and take responsibility.** Being polite goes a long way.
3. **Adjust your plan.** Maybe your dog can't be left alone at this hotel. Time for Plan B.

## Backup Plans: When You Can't Leave Your Dog

Sometimes it's just not going to work. Here are your options:

### Doggie Daycare

Many cities have daycare facilities that accept drop-ins. Apps like Rover can help you find local options quickly. Some hotels even have partnerships with nearby daycares.

**Tip:** Some daycares require a temperament test or vaccination records. Call ahead or check their website before you show up.

### Pet Sitters

Rover and Care.com have sitters who will watch your dog for a few hours. You can often find someone willing to come to your hotel or take your dog to their home.

### Hotel Pet Services

Some upscale hotels offer pet sitting or dog walking services. Ask at the front desk. Kimpton properties sometimes have recommendations for local services.

### Bring Your Dog With You

More restaurants have dog-friendly patios than you might think. Check BringFido or Yelp for options. Many breweries, coffee shops, and outdoor venues welcome dogs.

## The Bottom Line

Yes, you can often leave your dog alone in a hotel room — but it depends on the hotel, your dog, and how you prepare.

**Before you book:**
- Call and confirm the policy
- Be honest about your dog's behavior
- Have a backup plan

**Before you leave:**
- Tire your dog out
- Do a test run
- Leave familiar items, background noise, and the Do Not Disturb sign

**If your dog can't handle it:**
- That's okay. Use daycare, a sitter, or bring them with you.

The goal is a stress-free trip for everyone — you, your dog, and the other hotel guests.

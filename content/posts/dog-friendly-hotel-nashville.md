Nashville is one of the most dog-friendly cities in the South. Between the patios, the massive dog parks, and a food scene that welcomes pups at almost every outdoor table, it's a natural road trip destination for dog owners. And it has exactly what I look for: a great hotel you can book free with points.

Here's everything you need to know about visiting Nashville with your dog.

## My Pick: Kimpton Aertson Hotel

**Why this one?**

This is the clear winner for dog travelers:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Pet fee** | None |
| **Weight limit** | None |
| **# of pets** | No limit |
| **Breed restrictions** | None |
| **Location** | Midtown, near Vanderbilt |
| **Book free with** | IHG One Rewards points |

Kimpton's pet policy is the gold standard. No fee, no weight limit, no breed restrictions. They provide pet beds, bowls, and treats at check-in. Your 70-lb Lab mix? Welcome. Your two Great Danes? Also welcome.

The Aertson is in Midtown, which puts you walking distance from great restaurants and about a 10-minute drive from downtown Broadway. It's a better location for dogs than staying right on Broadway — less crowded, more green space, and easier for morning walks.

## The Pet Policy Details

Kimpton genuinely loves pets:

- **No weight limit** — If your dog fits in the elevator, they're welcome
- **No breed restrictions** — None at the corporate level
- **No pet fee** — $0
- **Pet amenities provided** — Beds, bowls, treats, and waste bags
- **Pets can be left unattended** — If you notify the front desk
- **Nightly wine hour** — Dogs are welcome to join

They partner with dog walking services if you need someone to take your pup out while you're at a show or dinner.

## How to Book It Free

Kimpton is part of IHG, so you book with IHG One Rewards points. Nashville typically runs 50,000-70,000 points per night depending on events and season.

**The math:**

- The [IHG One Rewards Premier card](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/) has a 175,000 point sign-up bonus
- That's 2-3 free nights at this property
- You'd pay $0 in pet fees

Cash rates run $250-400/night depending on the season, so points deliver solid value — especially since you're avoiding the $75-150 pet fees other Nashville hotels charge.

## A Note About Broadway

Broadway is not ideal for dogs. It's loud, crowded, and most honky-tonks don't allow dogs inside. If you want to experience Broadway, leave your pup at daycare or the hotel.

That said, some rooftop bars on Broadway allow dogs on their outdoor patios. Call ahead to confirm current policies.

---

## Other Hotels I Considered

If Kimpton Aertson doesn't work for your dates:

**Graduate Nashville** — Hilton property in Midtown near Vanderbilt. Accepts dogs with a $75 fee and 50 lb limit. Fun, quirky decor.

**Thompson Nashville** — Hyatt property in The Gulch. Accepts dogs up to 40 lbs with a $100 fee.

**Home2 Suites Nashville Downtown** — Hilton extended-stay with kitchens. 75 lb limit, $75-100 pet fee. Good for longer stays.

**Loews Vanderbilt Hotel** — Loews has no weight limits and provides pet amenities, but fees run $100+.

The Kimpton remains the best value: no fees, no limits, great location.

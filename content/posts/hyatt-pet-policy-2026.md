Hyatt's weight limits vary significantly:

| Brand | Typical Weight Limit |
|-------|---------------------|
| Hyatt Place | 50 lbs |
| Hyatt House | 50 lbs |
| Hyatt Regency | 50 lbs (varies) |

## Most Dog-Friendly Hyatt Brands

### Thompson Hotels ⭐ Best for Dog Lovers

Thompson is Hyatt's boutique luxury brand, and they have a reputation for being genuinely dog-friendly:

- No official weight limit at many properties
- Dog-friendly culture (not just tolerance)
- Often provide beds, bowls, and treats
- Stylish properties in great urban locations

**Locations:** Nashville, Seattle, Denver, Dallas, San Antonio, Savannah, and more.

**The catch:** Thompson properties book with World of Hyatt points but can be pricey (20,000–40,000 points/night).

### Hyatt House ⭐ Best for Extended Stays

- Kitchen in every suite (store dog food, prep meals)
- Residential feel with more space
- Consistent 50 lb policy
- Great for longer trips

### Hyatt Place ⭐ Best Value

- Reliable, consistent pet policy
- Spacious rooms with couch area
- Usually lower points cost than full-service brands
- Good availability nationwide

### Andaz ⭐ Most Lenient Policies

Andaz is Hyatt's lifestyle boutique brand:

- Some properties have no pet fees
- No official weight limits at many locations
- Boutique feel with local character

**Note:** Andaz policies vary significantly by property — always call ahead.

## Tips for Booking Hyatt with Your Dog

### 1. Always Call the Property

Hyatt gives individual properties more discretion than other chains. The website might say "pet-friendly," but you need to confirm:

- Exact pet fee
- Weight limit at that specific property
- Any breed restrictions
- Pet relief areas on property

### 2. Check for Pet-Friendly Room Types

Some Hyatt properties designate specific rooms for pets. You may have limited room choices or floor assignments.

### 3. Request a Ground Floor Room

Ask for a room near an exit for easy potty breaks. First-floor rooms near a side door are ideal.

### 4. Join World of Hyatt (Free)

Even if you're paying cash, join the free loyalty program:

- Earn points on your stay
- Elite members get better room assignments
- Points toward free future nights

### 5. Know the Rules

Most Hyatt properties require:

- Dogs on leash in public areas
- Dogs cannot be left unattended in rooms (or must be crated)
- You're responsible for any damage
- No dogs in pool, fitness center, or restaurant areas (except pet-friendly patios)

## How to Book Hyatt Free with Points

Here's how Hyatt fits into the points strategy:

### Option 1: Chase Sapphire Preferred (Recommended)

The [Chase Sapphire Preferred](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/) earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points that transfer 1:1 to World of Hyatt.

**The math:**

- Chase Sapphire Preferred has a 75,000 point sign-up bonus
- That's 75,000 World of Hyatt points after transfer
- Enough for 3-5 free nights at most Hyatt Place/Hyatt House properties

**Why this works:** Hyatt has some of the best point redemption values in the industry. A $250/night Hyatt Place might cost only 12,000–15,000 points. That's nearly 2 cents per point in value.

### Option 2: World of Hyatt Credit Card

If you stay at Hyatt frequently, the World of Hyatt card offers:

- 60,000 point bonus after spending requirements
- Free night certificate annually (up to Category 4)
- Automatic Discoverist status

**The catch:** It's a more niche card. The Chase Sapphire Preferred is more flexible since points transfer to multiple programs.

### Points Costs by Brand

| Brand | Typical Points/Night |
|-------|---------------------|
| Hyatt Place | 8,000–15,000 |
| Hyatt House | 8,000–15,000 |
| Caption by Hyatt | 9,000–15,000 |
| Hyatt Centric | 12,000–20,000 |
| Hyatt Regency | 12,000–25,000 |
| Thompson Hotels | 20,000–40,000 |
| Andaz | 15,000–30,000 |
| Grand Hyatt | 20,000–35,000 |
| Park Hyatt | 30,000–45,000 |

Hyatt uses dynamic pricing, so points costs fluctuate based on demand.

## Hyatt vs. Other Chains for Pet Travel

| | Hyatt | Hilton | IHG/Kimpton | Marriott |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pet fee** | $50–$150 | $50–$95 | $0 (Kimpton) | $50–$250 |
| **Weight limit** | ~50 lbs | ~75 lbs | None (Kimpton) | Varies |
| **Best brand for dogs** | Thompson | Home2/Embassy | Kimpton | Residence Inn |
| **Points transfer** | Chase UR | Amex (direct) | Chase UR | Chase UR, Amex |

**My take:** Hyatt is a solid option, especially Thompson and Andaz properties. But if your dog is over 50 lbs, Kimpton (IHG) is usually the better choice — no fees, no limits.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I bring 2 dogs to Hyatt?

Policies vary by property. Many allow 2 pets, but some limit to 1. Always confirm when booking.

### Are there breed restrictions at Hyatt?

No corporate breed restrictions, but individual properties may have their own policies due to local laws or insurance. Call ahead if you have a commonly restricted breed.

### Can I leave my dog alone in the room?

Varies by property. Some require dogs to be crated if left alone. Others don't allow pets to be left unattended at all. Ask at check-in.

### Does Hyatt provide pet amenities?

Some properties (especially Thompson and Andaz) offer beds, bowls, and treats. It's not guaranteed — bring your own supplies.

### What if my dog damages the room?

You'll be charged for any damage. The pet fee doesn't cover damage — it's just a cleaning/accommodation fee.

---

## The Bottom Line

Hyatt is a good option for dog travelers, especially if you're eyeing Thompson or Andaz properties. The 50 lb weight limit at most brands is more restrictive than Hilton's 75 lbs, but policies are generally reasonable.

The key advantage is **value**: Hyatt points go further than almost any other hotel currency. If you have Chase Ultimate Rewards from the Sapphire Preferred, transferring to Hyatt for pet-friendly stays is a smart play.

Just remember to call the specific property before booking — Hyatt gives hotels more individual discretion than other chains.

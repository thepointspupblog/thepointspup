December is a great month to grab a new travel card. Several bonuses are at historic highs, and a few limited-time offers expire in January.

Here are the best credit card bonuses right now for dog travelers — ranked by how useful they are for booking dog-friendly hotels.

## 🏆 Top Pick: Hilton Surpass

**Bonus:** 155,000 Hilton Honors points after $3,000 spend in 6 months  
**Annual fee:** $150  
**Offer expires:** January 14, 2026

This is the sweet spot for dog travelers. The 155,000-point bonus is enough for 3-5 free nights at most dog-friendly Hilton properties. You also get:

- Automatic Gold status (80% bonus points on stays)
- Up to $200/year in Hilton statement credits
- 10 free nights toward Diamond status
- Path to Diamond if you spend $40k/year

**Why it's great for dog travel:** Every Hilton brand welcomes dogs with no breed restrictions, and most have no weight limits. Gold status gets you late checkout — crucial when you need extra time for that morning dog walk.

**My take:** This is the card I recommend most. The bonus is high, the fee is reasonable, and Hilton's footprint means you'll always find a dog-friendly option.

## 💎 Premium Pick: Hilton Aspire

**Bonus:** 175,000 Hilton Honors points after $6,000 spend in 6 months  
**Annual fee:** $550  
**Offer expires:** January 14, 2026

The Aspire is Hilton's top-tier card, and 175,000 points is a solid bonus (though we've seen it higher). You get:

- Automatic Diamond status (the top tier)
- Free night certificate annually (worth up to $400+)
- Up to $400/year in Hilton resort credits
- Up to $200/year in airline fee credits
- Priority Pass lounge access

**Why it's great for dog travel:** Diamond status means complimentary breakfast at most properties and room upgrades when available. The free night certificate alone can offset the annual fee.

**My take:** Only worth it if you stay 10+ nights at Hilton annually. Otherwise, the Surpass is a better value.

## 🏨 Best for Kimpton Lovers: IHG Premier

**Bonus:** 140,000 IHG One Rewards points after $3,000 spend in 3 months  
**Annual fee:** $99

If you love Kimpton (and you should — they're the most dog-friendly chain), this is your card. The bonus gets you:

- 3-4 free nights at most Kimpton properties
- Automatic Platinum Elite status
- Free night certificate annually (up to 40,000 points, can top up with more)
- 4th night free on award stays

**Why it's great for dog travel:** Kimpton has NO weight limits, NO pet fees, and NO breed restrictions. The 4th night free perk is huge — book 4 nights and you're essentially getting 25% off.

**My take:** If there's a Kimpton where you travel, this card is a no-brainer. The $99 fee pays for itself with the annual free night.

## 🆓 Best No-Annual-Fee Option: Hilton Honors Card

**Bonus:** 100,000 Hilton Honors points after $2,000 spend in 6 months  
**Annual fee:** $0  
**Offer expires:** January 14, 2026

New to points? Start here. 100,000 points with no annual fee is excellent for beginners. You get:

- Automatic Silver status
- 7x points at Hilton properties
- 5th night free on award stays

**Why it's great for DOG travel:** Zero commitment, solid bonus. Use this to test whether Hilton works for your travel style before upgrading to the Surpass.

**My take:** Perfect first card. Grab it, hit the bonus, then decide if you want to upgrade later.

## 🏢 Best for Business Owners: Hilton Business

**Bonus:** 175,000 Hilton Honors points after $8,000 spend in 6 months  
**Annual fee:** $195  
**Offer expires:** January 14, 2026

If you have a business (even a side hustle), this is the highest Hilton bonus available right now. You get:

- Automatic Gold status
- Up to $240/year in Hilton credits ($60 quarterly)
- Path to Diamond at $40k spend
- 12x points at Hilton, 5x on other purchases

**Why it's great for dog travel:** Same Hilton benefits as the personal cards, but with a bigger bonus and better earning rates on everyday spend.

## My Recommendation

**If you're new to points:** Get the no-annual-fee Hilton card. Zero risk, 100,000 points, and you can upgrade later.

**If you're ready to commit:** Get the Hilton Surpass. It's the best balance of bonus, benefits, and annual fee for dog travelers.

**If you love Kimpton:** Get the IHG Premier. No other hotel chain treats dogs as well as Kimpton, and 140,000 points is a strong bonus.

**If you can handle two cards:** Get BOTH the Hilton Surpass and IHG Premier. You'll have 295,000+ points across two programs, covering almost any dog-friendly destination.

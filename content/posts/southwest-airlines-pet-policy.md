Southwest is one of the most popular airlines for pet owners, and for good reason: no change fees, straightforward pricing, and a relatively simple pet policy. But there are still rules you need to know before booking.

## Southwest Pet Policy Details

### What's Allowed

Southwest allows **small dogs and cats** in the cabin. That's it — no other animals (except trained service animals).

- **One pet per passenger** — You can't bring two dogs even if they'd fit in one carrier
- **Pet must stay in carrier** — For the entire flight, under the seat in front of you
- **Carrier counts as carry-on** — You still get one personal item

### Weight Limits

Southwest doesn't have an official weight limit, but your pet + carrier must fit **completely under the seat in front of you**. Realistically, this means:

- Dogs under ~15-17 lbs
- Carrier dimensions max: 18.5" L x 8.5" H x 13.5" W

If your dog is pushing 20 lbs, it's going to be tight. And if they don't fit, you won't be allowed to board.

### No Cargo Option

**Southwest does not transport pets in cargo.** If your dog is too large for the cabin, Southwest is not an option. Period.

For larger dogs, you'd need to look at Delta, United, or American — all of which have cargo programs (with significant restrictions).

---

## Fees

- **$125 each way** — Paid at the airport, not online
- **Cash, credit, or debit** accepted
- **Each direction is charged separately** — Round trip = $250 total

The fee is per carrier, not per pet. But since Southwest only allows one pet per passenger, this is effectively per pet.

---

## How to Book

1. **Book your flight first** — You cannot add a pet during online booking
2. **Call Southwest** — 1-800-435-9792 — to add your pet to the reservation
3. **Or add at the airport** — Arrive early and tell the agent at check-in
4. **Pay at the gate** — Pet fee is collected when you check in

**Important:** Southwest limits the number of pets per flight (usually 6). Call ahead to make sure there's space, especially on popular routes.

## Carrier Requirements

Your carrier must:

- Be **soft-sided** or hard-sided (soft-sided is easier to fit)
- Fit completely **under the seat** (18.5" x 8.5" x 13.5" max)
- Be **leak-proof** and well-ventilated
- Allow your pet to **stand and turn around**
- Stay **closed** for the entire flight

### Recommended Carriers

Look for carriers specifically designed for airline travel. Popular options:

- **Sherpa Original Deluxe** — Airline-approved, fits most under-seat spaces
- **Sleepypod Air** — Crash-tested, premium option
- **AmazonBasics Soft-Sided Carrier** — Budget-friendly, gets the job done

Always measure your carrier against Southwest's dimensions before flying.

---

## Breed Restrictions

Southwest has **no breed restrictions** for in-cabin pets. Pit bulls, Rottweilers, and other commonly restricted breeds are allowed in the cabin (as long as they fit in a carrier under the seat — which, realistically, they won't).

This is different from cargo policies at other airlines, which often restrict snub-nosed breeds.

## Tips for Flying Southwest with Your Dog

### 1. Book Early Boarding

Southwest's open seating means early boarding = better seat selection. With a pet, you want:

- A window seat (more floor space for carrier)
- Avoid bulkhead rows (no under-seat storage)
- Avoid exit rows (pets not allowed)

Pay for Early Bird Check-In or check in exactly 24 hours before departure.

### 2. Choose Direct Flights

Every connection is another opportunity for stress. Book direct whenever possible.

### 3. Exercise Before the Flight

Tire your dog out before heading to the airport. A sleepy dog is a quiet dog.

### 4. Skip Food Before Flying

Feed your dog 4-6 hours before the flight to avoid upset stomachs. Water is fine.

### 5. Bring Essentials in Your Personal Item

- Poop bags
- Paper towels
- Treats
- Collapsible water bowl
- Puppy pad (in case of accidents in carrier)

### 6. Potty Before Security

Most airports have pet relief areas before and after security. Use them.

## What to Expect at the Airport

### Check-In

- Tell the agent you're traveling with a pet
- Pay the $125 fee
- They may ask to see your pet and carrier

### TSA Security

- **You carry the dog** — Remove your dog from the carrier
- **Carrier goes through X-ray** — Like any other bag
- **Walk through with your dog** — Carry them or walk them on leash through the metal detector
- **Put dog back in carrier** immediately after screening

This is the most stressful part for most dogs. Practice at home if possible.

### Boarding

- Board with your group
- Store carrier under the seat in front of you
- Carrier must stay closed and under the seat for the entire flight

### During the Flight

- Your dog must stay in the carrier
- You can reach in to comfort them
- Keep the carrier zipped/closed

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I buy a seat for my dog?

No. Southwest does not allow pets in seats. The carrier must go under the seat in front of you.

### Can I bring two dogs?

Only if you're traveling with another person. Each passenger can bring one pet in one carrier.

### What if my dog barks the whole flight?

This is why preparation matters. A tired, comfortable dog is less likely to bark. If your dog has severe anxiety, talk to your vet about options before flying.

### Can I fly with a puppy?

Yes, but puppies must be at least 8 weeks old.

### Are emotional support animals free?

No. As of 2021, Southwest (like most airlines) no longer recognizes emotional support animals. Only trained psychiatric service dogs fly free.

### What about service dogs?

Trained service dogs fly free and are not required to be in a carrier. Southwest requires documentation submitted in advance.

## The Bottom Line

Southwest is a solid choice for flying with small dogs:

- **Pros:** No change fees, simple policy, no breed restrictions, points are easy to earn
- **Cons:** No cargo option, limited pets per flight, fee adds up on round trips

If your dog fits comfortably in an under-seat carrier, Southwest works well. If your dog is over ~15 lbs, it's going to be a squeeze — and over ~20 lbs, you'll need to look at other options or drive.

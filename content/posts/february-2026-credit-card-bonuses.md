If you missed the Hilton bonuses that expired in January, don't worry — there are still some excellent offers on the table right now.

In fact, the **Marriott Bonvoy Boundless** card just launched one of the best welcome bonuses I've seen: 5 free night certificates worth up to 250,000 points total. And IHG quietly bumped their Premier card to 175,000 points.

Here's the full breakdown of what's worth grabbing this month for dog travelers — and which cards will actually let you book hotels that welcome your pup.

## The Headline Deal: Marriott 5 Free Nights

The Marriott Bonvoy Boundless just brought back its best offer — and made it even better.

### Marriott Bonvoy Boundless

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bonus** | 5 Free Night Awards (each up to 50,000 points) |
| **Spend Requirement** | $3,000 in 3 months |
| **Annual Fee** | $95 |
| **Status** | Silver Elite |
| **Offer Expires** | March 11, 2026 |

That's potentially **250,000 points worth of free nights** — the highest value sign-up bonus available right now. And the minimum spend is only $3,000, down from the $5,000 it used to require.

**Bonus perk:** New cardmembers also get up to $100 in statement credits on airline purchases ($50 semi-annually through October 2026).

**The dog-friendly breakdown:**
- ✅ TownePlace Suites: Often accepts dogs up to 100 lbs
- ✅ Residence Inn: All locations pet-friendly, weight limits vary
- ✅ Element by Westin: All locations pet-friendly
- ⚠️ Other brands: Highly inconsistent — always call the specific property
- 💰 Pet fees: $75-$150 per stay

**What 5 free nights gets you:** A full week of travel, or two long weekend trips. Each certificate works at properties up to 50,000 points per night (you can top up with 15K more points if needed).

**The catch:** Marriott's pet policies are all over the map. One TownePlace might allow 100 lb dogs, another might cap at 50 lbs. You MUST call the specific property before booking to verify they'll accept your dog.

**Worth it if:** You don't mind doing a little research before each trip. This bonus is too good to pass up if there are dog-friendly Marriott properties where you travel.

## Best for Large Dogs: IHG Premier (175K)

If you have a large dog — or just want zero hassle — the IHG Premier card is running an elevated bonus right now.

### IHG One Rewards Premier

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bonus** | 175,000 points |
| **Spend Requirement** | $5,000 in 3 months |
| **Annual Fee** | $99 |
| **Status** | Platinum Elite |
| **Free Night** | Annual certificate (up to 40,000 points) |

This is 35,000 points higher than the standard 140,000-point offer. The tradeoff is a higher spend requirement ($5,000 vs $3,000).

**Why IHG matters for dog owners:** IHG owns Kimpton, and **Kimpton has no weight limits, no breed restrictions, and no pet fees.**

If you have a Great Dane, a pit bull, a German Shepherd, or any dog over 75 lbs, Kimpton is basically your only reliable option among major hotel chains.

**The dog-friendly breakdown:**
- ✅ Kimpton: NO weight limit, NO pet fee, NO breed restrictions
- ✅ Candlewood Suites: Up to 80 lbs, $75-$150 fee
- ✅ Staybridge Suites: Up to 50 lbs (varies), ~$75/week
- ⚠️ Holiday Inn/Hotel Indigo: Varies widely by property

**What 175,000 points gets you:** 4-5 free nights at most Kimptons, depending on location and dates.

**The killer perk:** 4th night free on award stays. Book 4 nights with points, pay for 3. That's 25% off every longer stay.

**Worth it if:** You have a large dog (over 75 lbs) OR you want guaranteed pet-friendly stays with zero fees. The $99 annual fee pays for itself with the free night certificate alone.

## Hilton Cards: Still Good, Just Lower

If you were holding out for a Hilton card, you missed the elevated bonuses that expired January 14th. But the current offers are still solid — just not as eye-popping.

### Hilton Honors American Express Surpass

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bonus** | 130,000 points |
| **Spend Requirement** | $3,000 in 6 months |
| **Annual Fee** | $150 |
| **Status** | Gold |

Down from 155,000 points in January, but 130,000 is still enough for 2-3 free nights at most dog-friendly Hilton properties.

**The dog-friendly breakdown:**
- ✅ ALL Hilton brands accept dogs
- ✅ Most properties: up to 75 lbs
- ✅ No breed restrictions at corporate level
- 💰 Pet fees: $50-$95 per stay

**Worth it if:** You want the biggest footprint (7,000+ hotels) and consistent policies. Hilton is reliable — you know what you're getting.

### Hilton Honors American Express Aspire

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bonus** | 150,000 points |
| **Spend Requirement** | $6,000 in 6 months |
| **Annual Fee** | $550 |
| **Status** | Diamond (top tier) |

Down from 175,000 points. The $550 annual fee is steep, but you get a free night certificate ($300+ value), $400 in resort credits, and $200 in airline credits that can offset most of it.

**Worth it if:** You stay at Hilton 10+ nights per year and want Diamond perks (breakfast, upgrades, late checkout).

---

### Hilton Honors American Express (No Fee)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bonus** | ~80,000 points (varies) |
| **Spend Requirement** | $2,000 in 6 months |
| **Annual Fee** | $0 |
| **Status** | Silver |

Still the best risk-free option. Zero annual fee, decent bonus, and you can upgrade to the Surpass later if Hilton works for you.

| Card | Bonus | Spend | Annual Fee | Best For | Deadline |

| **Marriott Boundless** | 5 Free Nights (250K value) | $3,000 / 3 mo | $95 | Best overall value | March 11 |

## My Recommendation

Here's what I'd do this month based on your situation:

### If you want the biggest bang for your buck:
**Grab the Marriott Boundless before March 11th.** Five free nights worth up to 250,000 points for just $3,000 in spending is exceptional. Yes, Marriott's pet policies require more homework, but TownePlace Suites and Residence Inn are often great for dogs.

### If your dog is over 75 lbs:
**Get the IHG Premier.** Kimpton is the only major chain that will reliably accept large dogs with no questions asked. 175,000 points is an elevated offer — the standard is 140K.

### If you want consistency over research:
**Go with the Hilton Surpass.** Every Hilton brand accepts dogs, most allow up to 75 lbs, and there are 7,000+ properties. You won't have to call ahead to verify policies every time.

### If you're new to points:
**Start with the no-fee Hilton card.** Zero risk, decent bonus, and you can upgrade later once you know if Hilton works for your travel style.

### If you can handle two cards:
**Get BOTH the Marriott Boundless AND the IHG Premier.** You'll have 5 free nights plus 175,000 IHG points — covering different types of properties and destinations. Use Marriott for extended-stay brands, IHG for Kimpton when you need guaranteed large-dog acceptance.

## What Changed Since January

Quick recap if you're catching up:

**Expired January 14:**
- Hilton Aspire: 175,000 → 150,000 points
- Hilton Surpass: 155,000 → 130,000 points
- Hilton Business: 175,000 → lower
- Hilton No-Fee: 100,000 → ~80,000 points

**New/improved:**
- Marriott Boundless: 5 free nights offer returned (through March 11)
- IHG Premier: Elevated to 175,000 points

The Hilton offers were at historic highs, so the drop was expected. If you're not in a rush, Hilton bonuses tend to get elevated again around spring or summer.

---

## The Bottom Line

February 2026 is actually a solid month to grab a travel card. The Marriott 5-night offer is one of the best I've seen, and IHG's 175K bonus is great for large dog owners.

If you've been on the fence, the Marriott deadline (March 11) gives you a few weeks to decide. But don't sleep on it — these elevated offers tend to disappear without much warning.

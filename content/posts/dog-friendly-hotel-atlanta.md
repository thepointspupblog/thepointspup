Atlanta is one of the most dog-friendly cities in the South. Between Piedmont Park, the BeltLine, and an endless supply of dog-friendly breweries and patios, it's practically built for traveling with your pup.

The challenge? Finding a hotel that doesn't charge you $150 in pet fees or restrict you to dogs under 50 lbs. Fortunately, there's a clear winner.

## My Pick: Kimpton Sylvan Hotel (Buckhead)

**Why this one?**

Same story as Charlotte and Savannah — Kimpton's pet policy is unbeatable:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Pet fee** | None |
| **Weight limit** | None ("if it fits in the elevator") |
| **# of pets** | No limit |
| **Breed restrictions** | None |
| **Location** | Buckhead, Atlanta |
| **Book free with** | IHG One Rewards points |

The Sylvan is a converted 1950s residential building that Kimpton turned into a boutique hotel. It feels more like a retreat than a typical hotel — there's 5,000 square feet of gardens, a rooftop bar, and a supper club-style restaurant called The Betty. Mid-century vibes throughout.

Buckhead is Atlanta's upscale neighborhood, with high-end shopping, galleries, and dining within walking distance. You're about 15 minutes from Midtown and Piedmont Park by car (or Uber).

## The Pet Policy Details

Kimpton's policy at the Sylvan:

- **No weight limit** — Any size welcome
- **No breed restrictions** — None
- **No pet fee** — $0
- **Pet amenities provided** — Beds, bowls, treats, waste bags
- **Pets can be left unattended** — With front desk notification
- **Director of Pet Relations** — Some Kimptons have a resident dog that greets guests

They also partner with Wag! for dog walking services, and there's a pet concierge list of nearby dog-friendly restaurants, groomers, and parks.

**Note:** The $300 damage deposit (refunded at checkout) is standard for all guests, not just pet owners.

---

## How to Book It Free

Kimpton Sylvan is bookable with IHG One Rewards points. Atlanta rates vary a lot by date and demand, but expect somewhere in the 50,000-80,000 points per night range.

**The math:**

- The [IHG One Rewards Premier card](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/) has a 140,000 point sign-up bonus
- That's 1-2 free nights at this property
- You'd pay $0 in pet fees

Cash rates typically run $200-350/night, so points redemptions can be solid value here — especially when you factor in the pet fee savings compared to other Atlanta hotels.

## Other Kimpton Options in Atlanta

If the Sylvan is booked, Atlanta has two other Kimptons:

**Kimpton Shane Hotel (Midtown)** — Right near Piedmont Park, which makes it arguably more convenient for dog owners. Same pet policy (no fee, no weight limit). They even have a "Pampered Pooch" package and host "Yappy Hour" at their bar, Aveline.

**Kimpton Overland Hotel (Airport)** — Near Hartsfield-Jackson, about 15 minutes from downtown. Good option if you're flying in/out and want to minimize travel. Same great pet policy.

All three have identical pet policies — pick based on location and availability.

## Dog Daycare While You Explore

Atlanta has a lot to see: the Georgia Aquarium, World of Coca-Cola, the Atlanta History Center, CNN headquarters. Most of these don't allow dogs, so you'll need a plan.

### Barking Hound Village (Multiple Locations)

Voted Atlanta's best dog daycare multiple times. They have six locations across the city, including Buckhead and Sandy Springs (both convenient to the Sylvan).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Buckhead Address** | 1898 Piedmont Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30324 |
| **Hours** | Varies by location, typically 7am-7pm |
| **Phone** | (404) 873-7877 |

The Buckhead and Sandy Springs locations have climate-controlled indoor play yards. Other locations have outdoor areas. All dogs need to pass an evaluation before their first visit.

**What to bring:** Your own food (pre-bagged by meal) and any medications. They provide beds.

### Puppy Haven (Buckhead & Chastain)

Highly rated on Yelp and Google. They offer daycare, boarding, training, and have webcams so you can watch your pup play from your phone.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Buckhead Address** | 2900 Peachtree Rd NW, Atlanta, GA 30305 |
| **Hours** | Mon-Fri 7am-7pm, Sat-Sun 9am-5pm |

Great reviews for cleanliness and staff friendliness. They also offer a "Stay and Train" program if your dog could use some extra manners work.

### Bark ATL (Downtown/Midtown)

Cage-free boarding and daycare in the heart of Atlanta. A staff member sleeps with the dogs overnight — so it's more like a slumber party than a kennel.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Address** | 640 Glen Iris Dr NE, Atlanta, GA 30308 |
| **Hours** | 7am-7pm daily |

Smaller playgroups, streaming webcams, and baths/nail trims available. Good option if you're staying in Midtown near the Shane.

### Piedmont Bark (Midtown)

Located right in Midtown, close to Piedmont Park. Offers daycare, boarding, and grooming. Known for cage-free boarding and 24-hour care options.

### The Dog Yard ATL

This one's unique: it's a 500-acre cattle farm in Monroe, Georgia (about 45 minutes from Atlanta). Your dog gets to run in fenced pastures and swim in a lake. They offer door-to-door pickup/dropoff from Buckhead, Midtown, and other Atlanta neighborhoods.

If your dog has a lot of energy and you want them to actually be tired when you pick them up, this is the move.

---

## Dog Parks

Atlanta has excellent off-leash options:

### Piedmont Park Dog Park

The most popular dog park in Atlanta, located in Piedmont Park (Midtown). Over 3 acres of off-leash space with separate areas for large and small dogs.

- **Location:** Inside Piedmont Park, near the Park Drive entrance
- **Features:** Water fountains, benches, shade, waste stations
- **Hours:** Dawn to dusk
- **Tips:** Can get crowded on weekend mornings. Best to go early.

### Fetch Park (Multiple Locations)

This is Atlanta's version of Skiptown — an off-leash dog park combined with a bar. Locations in Old Fourth Ward, Buckhead, and other neighborhoods.

- **Buckhead Location:** Walking distance from the Sylvan
- **How it works:** Pay for a day pass or membership, let your dog play off-leash, grab drinks from the Airstream bar
- **Events:** Dog costume parties, "yappy hours," adoption events

Great way to let your dog socialize while you have a beer.

## Dog-Friendly Breweries

Atlanta's craft beer scene has exploded, and most breweries welcome dogs on their patios.

- **Address:** 195 Ottley Dr NE, Atlanta, GA 30324

### Aveline at Kimpton Shane (Midtown)

The cocktail bar at the Kimpton Shane hosts a seasonal "Yappy Hour" where both dogs and humans have their own menus. Worth the trip if you're staying at the Sylvan.

## What Else to Do

### Walk the BeltLine

The Atlanta BeltLine is a 22-mile loop of multi-use trails connecting neighborhoods around the city. The Eastside Trail (from Piedmont Park to Ponce City Market) is the most popular stretch and is completely dog-friendly. Great for morning runs or evening strolls.

### Piedmont Park

280 acres of green space in Midtown, including the dog park, walking paths, and Lake Clara Meer. This is ground zero for dog owners in Atlanta.

### Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area

Just outside the city, with hiking trails along the Chattahoochee River. Dogs must be leashed but it's a great escape from the urban scene.

## Other Hotels I Considered

If all three Kimptons are booked:

**Loews Atlanta Hotel (Midtown)** — Near Piedmont Park, $75 pet fee, 2 dogs max. Nice property but the fee adds up.

**W Atlanta - Buckhead** — Marriott property, accepts pets but has fees and weight limits.

**Grand Hyatt Atlanta (Buckhead)** — Walking distance to shopping and dining, pet-friendly but with restrictions.

**Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta (Midtown)** — Ultra-luxury, pet-friendly, but this is cash-only territory. Not a points play.

The Kimpton properties are the clear winners for dog travelers who want to avoid fees and restrictions.

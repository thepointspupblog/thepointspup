Happy New Year from me and Ansel 🐾

I've been writing about traveling with dogs for a while now, and I'll admit — sometimes it feels like I'm shouting into the void. Most travel content assumes you're leaving your dog behind. Most hotel guides don't mention pet fees. Most credit card reviews don't consider whether you can actually *use* those points at places that welcome your 70-pound pup.

But something shifted in 2025. And heading into 2026, the travel industry is finally catching up to what we've known all along: **dogs belong on the trip.**

## The Travel Industry Just Named Pet Travel Its #1 Trend

Amadeus — one of the biggest travel technology companies in the world — just released their 2026 Travel Trends report. Their top trend? **The Pawprint Economy.**

That's not a cute marketing name. It's a recognition that pet travel is now a driving force in how people book trips. According to the report, 27% of pet owners in the UK and US traveled with their pets for the first time in 2025. Bloomberg projects the global pet industry will hit $500 billion by 2030.

Hotels are paying attention too. Hilton's own 2026 trends report found that "pet-friendly" is the **fifth most popular search filter** on Hilton.com, with 64% of travelers searching for pet-friendly options when they plan trips.

This isn't a niche anymore. It's mainstream.

## What's Actually Changing in 2026

The trend reports are nice, but let's talk about what's actually happening on the ground.

### Airlines Are (Slowly) Getting Better

Italy's aviation authority now allows medium and large dogs in aircraft passenger cabins — a big deal for travelers who've been stuck with cargo-only options. SkyePets is launching long-haul in-cabin pet flights between Australia and the US in 2026. These are small steps, but they signal where the industry is heading.

### Hotels Are Adding Pet Perks to Loyalty Programs

AKA Hotels just added pets to their loyalty program — meaning your dog's stays can help you earn status and perks. I expect more hotel chains to follow. Kimpton has been doing this informally forever (they literally have a "Director of Pet Relations" at every property), but seeing it formalized in loyalty programs is new.

### The "Pet Fee" Conversation Is Shifting

For years, pet fees were positioned as "cleaning fees" — money you paid and got nothing for. Now, more hotels are rethinking this. As one industry expert put it: "Dog owners don't mind a $150 per stay fee as long as they and their dogs get something back in return. It's only when hotels call it a cleaning fee and give them nothing that they hate it."

I'm hopeful we'll see more properties follow Kimpton's lead (no fees, no limits, actual amenities) rather than the lazy "$75 cleaning fee" approach.

## What Hasn't Changed (And Still Works)

Here's the thing: most of what I've been writing about for years still applies. The fundamentals haven't changed.

### Hilton Is Still the Best Bet for Most Dog Travelers

Every Hilton brand welcomes dogs. Most properties allow dogs up to 75 lbs with no breed restrictions. Pet fees run $50–$95 per stay, which stings but is manageable when the room is free.

If you're traveling with a dog under 75 lbs, Hilton's 7,000+ properties mean you'll find an option almost anywhere.

**My setup:** I use the [Hilton Surpass](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/#-hilton-honors-american-express-surpass) for everyday spending and the Hilton Aspire for Diamond status and free night certificates. Between them, I haven't paid for a hotel room in years.

### Kimpton Is Still Unbeatable for Large Dogs

If your dog is over 75 lbs — or if you just want zero hassle — Kimpton remains the gold standard. No weight limits. No breed restrictions. No pet fees. Ever.

The trade-off is there are only ~70 Kimpton properties, mostly in major cities. But when there's a Kimpton where you're going, book it.

**My setup:** I keep the [IHG Premier card](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/#-ihg-one-rewards-premier-credit-card) for Kimpton stays. The 4th night free perk is huge for longer trips.

### Credit Card Points Still Make Pet Travel Affordable

Pet fees are unavoidable. But room rates don't have to be.

The math is simple: if a hotel room costs $200/night and the pet fee is $75, you're looking at $275+ per night. But if you book that same room with points and just pay the pet fee? That's $75 total. Much easier to stomach.

The best credit cards for dog travelers are still:
- **[Hilton Surpass](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/#-hilton-honors-american-express-surpass)** — 130,000 point bonus, $150/year, $200 in annual credits
- **[IHG Premier](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/#-ihg-one-rewards-premier-credit-card)** — 175,000 point bonus, $99/year, free night certificate
- **[Chase Sapphire Preferred](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/#-chase-sapphire-preferred)** — Flexible points that transfer to IHG, Hyatt, and more

## Where Ansel and I Are Headed in 2026

I don't have a rigid travel calendar, but here's what's on my radar:

**More Florida beach trips.** [Panama City Beach](/posts/pcb-embassy-suites-review/) was a hit last year, and I want to explore more of the Gulf Coast. Dog Beach made it so easy.

**A proper road trip.** I've been doing mostly long weekends. This year I want to do a longer stretch — maybe up the East Coast or out to Texas. Ansel is a great road trip dog, and I haven't fully tested that yet.

**At least one Kimpton stay.** I use Hilton most of the time because of the footprint, but I want to hit a Kimpton this year just to experience their pet program firsthand.

**More local exploration.** [Fernandina Beach](/posts/fernandina-beach-dog-guide/) is so close to Jacksonville and so dog-friendly. I want to do more day trips like that — low-effort, high-reward outings with Ansel.

## If You're New to Dog Travel in 2026

Welcome. You picked a good year to start.

Here's where I'd begin:

1. **Pick a hotel chain and learn their pet policy.** Don't try to master everything at once. If your dog is under 75 lbs, start with Hilton. If your dog is larger, start with Kimpton.

2. **Get one credit card.** The [Hilton Surpass](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/#-hilton-honors-american-express-surpass) is my go-to recommendation for most people — solid bonus, low fee, useful credits. If you have a large dog, the [IHG Premier](/posts/best-credit-cards-pet-travelers/#-ihg-one-rewards-premier-credit-card) for Kimpton access.

3. **Book one trip.** Don't overthink it. Pick a dog-friendly destination within driving distance, book it with points (or cash if you're still earning), and go. You'll learn more from one trip than from reading a hundred guides.

4. **Come back and tell me how it went.** Seriously — I love hearing from readers. Email me at [woof@thepointspup.com](mailto:woof@thepointspup.com) or [leave your pawprint](/page/leave-your-pawprint/).

## The Bottom Line

2026 is the year the travel industry finally admits what we've known all along: people want to travel with their dogs, and they're willing to pay for hotels that actually welcome them.

That's good news for us. More competition means better pet policies, more amenities, and (hopefully) fewer surprise fees at check-in.

But the fundamentals haven't changed. Hilton and Kimpton are still the best options. Credit card points still make it affordable. And the best way to learn is to book a trip and go.

Here's to a year of adventures with our pups. 🐾

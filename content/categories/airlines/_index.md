## Flying with Your Dog ✈️

Flying with a dog is more complicated than booking a hotel. Weight limits are strict, fees add up, and policies vary wildly between airlines.

This section breaks down what you need to know before you book.

### 🛫 AIRLINE PET POLICIES

Know the rules before you book. Each guide covers fees, weight limits, carrier requirements, and what to expect.

| Airline | In-Cabin | Fee | Weight Limit | Cargo Option |
|---------|----------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| [Southwest](/posts/southwest-airlines-pet-policy/) | ✅ | $125 each way | ~20 lbs | ❌ |
| [Delta](/posts/delta-airlines-pet-policy/) | ✅ | $150 each way | ~20 lbs | ✅ |
| [United](/posts/united-airlines-pet-policy/) | ✅ | $150 each way | ~20 lbs | ✅ |
| [American](/posts/american-airlines-pet-policy/) | ✅ | $150 each way | ~20 lbs | ✅ |

**Note:** "Weight limit" for in-cabin is combined weight of pet + carrier. Most airlines cap around 20 lbs total, which realistically means dogs under 15-17 lbs.

### 🐕 THE REALITY FOR MOST DOG OWNERS

Here's the honest truth: **if your dog is over 20 lbs, flying is difficult.**

In-cabin options are limited to small dogs. Cargo exists but comes with risks, restrictions, and seasonal embargoes. For most medium and large dog owners, driving is the better option.

That's why most of this site focuses on hotels and road trips — it's how the majority of us actually travel with our dogs.

**But if you have a small dog**, flying opens up a lot of possibilities. These guides will help you do it right.

### 💡 QUICK TIPS

1. **Book early** — Most airlines limit pets per flight (usually 2-4 in cabin)
2. **Call to confirm** — Online booking doesn't always add your pet correctly
3. **Measure your carrier** — Must fit under the seat in front of you
4. **Check breed restrictions** — Snub-nosed breeds (bulldogs, pugs) are often banned from cargo and sometimes cabin
5. **Avoid connections** — Direct flights reduce stress and risk

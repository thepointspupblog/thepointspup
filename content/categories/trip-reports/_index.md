## Trip Reports 🐾

These are real trips I've taken with Ansel, my 70-lb GSP/Lab mix. Each report covers the hotel, the destination, and how I used points to book it free.

### 🏖️ Florida Trips

- **[Panama City Beach: Embassy Suites Review](/posts/pcb-embassy-suites-review/)** — 5 nights at Embassy Suites, booked entirely on Hilton points. Ocean-view suite upgrade, Dog Beach access, and Pier Park right next door. Pet fee: $125 for 5+ nights.

### 📍 Coming Soon

I'm planning more trips with Ansel — check back for new reports:

- Kimpton property review (first Kimpton stay!)
- More Florida beach destinations
- Road trips beyond Florida

### ❓ Common Questions

**Which card should I get first?**
If you're new to points, start with the no-annual-fee Hilton card. Zero risk, 100,000 points, and you can upgrade later.

**Are annual fees worth it?**
Usually yes. The Hilton Surpass costs $150/year but gives you $200 in Hilton credits — you come out ahead before counting the points.

**Do I need good credit?**
Most travel cards require good to excellent credit (700+). If you're building credit, start with a regular cash-back card first.

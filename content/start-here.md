### Step 3: Pick Your Hotel Chain

Different chains work better for different dogs. Here's how to choose:

| Chain | Best For | Weight Limits |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Hilton** | Most travelers — huge footprint, solid pet policies | Usually 50-75 lbs |
| **Kimpton (IHG)** | Large dogs — no weight limits, no pet fees | None |
| **Marriott** | Sign-up bonus hunters — 3 free nights to start | Varies by property |

Diamond status means late checkout, room upgrades, and free breakfast — all things that make traveling with a dog easier. And you don't need to stay 60 nights to get it.
